00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:01.962
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:08.956
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:13.667
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:19.701
then I realised that today is a very good

00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:22.705
time according to the calendar;

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:27.748
but it is not in the morning,

00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:32.725
so it had to be the third day of the moon.

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:38.060
And as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.074
we had to wait till it started.

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:42.927
I think, all these things have happened,

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:47.840
of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:52.553
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:56.103
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

00:04:56.304 --> 00:04:59.169
and we don't have to worry about the timing.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.054
Only when it's a formal function or something,

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:06.741
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:10.278
So we have to be present there at right time,

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.257
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:18.418
and we should move in our own way.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.228
Now for our travel

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:32.608
and this tour, we have to realise

00:05:33.508 --> 00:05:40.258
that we are here to achieve

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:46.156
a certain amount of height in our detachment.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.164
We have to rise into the realm

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:57.100
of our state,

00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:01.863
while the circumstances around us,

00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:09.144
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

00:06:10.048 --> 00:06:15.613
or biased, or we should not react to them,

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:22.036
On the contrary we should try to rise above that.

00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:28.524
If there are no events of mishaps.

00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:33.814
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:41.816
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:44.984
we have to see the obstructions.

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:47.736
For example,

00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:52.945
if there is the flow of the water going on

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:56.825
and it is smoothly moving,

00:06:57.026 --> 00:07:02.076
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:07.021
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.021
then the water splashes against it,

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:15.466
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:22.108
this is the sign of Divine

00:07:22.396 --> 00:07:28.901
surmounting all the difficulties that are supposed to be there.

00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:32.935
Now we are proceeding to Pune

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:37.653
and where we will be having a proper session

00:07:37.854 --> 00:07:40.315
also for marriages and all that.

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:43.699
We will have to take a firm decision.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.111
I must speak about it today,

00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:53.681
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:58.390
If you have certain concepts

00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:04.804
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.788
because that's not found in Indian character,

00:08:08.983 --> 00:08:12.721
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.671
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:18.948
it's a trick of the mind

00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:22.688
that wants to play tricks with others

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:26.650
and enjoys, it is a sign of ego.

00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:29.377
Absolutely a sign of ego

00:08:29.578 --> 00:08:33.381
and then you start playing games,

00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:37.314
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no".

00:08:37.522 --> 00:08:40.700
You go on enjoying those games

00:08:41.026 --> 00:08:43.359
and later on you play into it so much

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.439
that your marriages can never be happy or successful.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.961
That means you are not yet matured for marriage.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:52.630
For marriage you are to be matured.

00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:55.784
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:59.415
that you have had no training at all.

00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:02.830
Parents have never told you how to behave

00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.033
towards your husband, towards your wife,

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:08.672
how to make a marriage successful.

00:09:08.873 --> 00:09:11.993
That is a very important event

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.784
and that we should try

00:09:14.985 --> 00:09:18.612
to establish ourselves in the marriage system.

00:09:18.813 --> 00:09:25.930
Instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

00:09:26.303 --> 00:09:30.086
we miss the point, who is the loser?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.073
If you go on playing tricks like this

00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:37.197
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:42.179
whatever you may do, whatever type of marriages you'll have,

00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:44.940
you can never be happy.

00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:48.957
Now in the west, as you know, I lead another life also

00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:51.794
and every person I have met,

00:09:52.032 --> 00:09:54.715
every person whatever country they may come,

00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:59.234
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.097
It seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

00:10:04.343 --> 00:10:06.855
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:10.348
and they have funny miserable faces.

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:15.555
They don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:18.383
or something has really gone wrong with them.

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:21.964
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:25.230
because they have missed the point.

00:10:25.547 --> 00:10:29.137
Marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:34.949
Supposing one gives you ambrose...,

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:39.043
ambrosia. "Amrut", as they call it

00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:43.202
and then you start playing trick with it.

00:10:43.403 --> 00:10:45.910
Who is the loser?

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:52.628
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:56.189
and enjoy that love.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.010
Basically if something is very wrong,

00:10:59.294 --> 00:11:04.812
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:08.908
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up.

00:11:09.427 --> 00:11:13.143
You can change your wife, change your husband, no problem.

00:11:13.344 --> 00:11:15.679
But there must be some reason behind it,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.696
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

00:11:22.061 --> 00:11:24.097
I'll try my level best to tell you

00:11:24.298 --> 00:11:27.541
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:32.377
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:34.747
when it comes to the ego part.

00:11:34.948 --> 00:11:38.536
They themselves cannot enjoy. "Dog in the manger" policy.

00:11:38.737 --> 00:11:41.936
Dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:46.101
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this.

00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:51.215
Neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy.

00:11:51.416 --> 00:11:54.908
And when such stupid couples are there,

00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:57.905
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

00:11:58.106 --> 00:11:59.906
talking to them, asking them.

00:12:00.107 --> 00:12:04.467
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:07.241
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

00:12:07.442 --> 00:12:11.045
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

00:12:11.246 --> 00:12:13.315
Actually what have I to gain out of it.

00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:15.286
This is nobody will try to understand.

00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:17.676
What I am trying is to make you happy,

00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:19.946
to get you good husbands and good wives,

00:12:20.163 --> 00:12:22.877
that you should have good relationships,

00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:26.372
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

00:12:26.573 --> 00:12:29.243
that we should have a society

00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:33.410
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies,

00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:38.455
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

00:12:38.656 --> 00:12:42.593
among ourselves of purity and of holiness.

00:12:42.794 --> 00:12:45.963
Instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

00:12:46.164 --> 00:12:50.010
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:54.132
Of course one has to try.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:57.777
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

00:12:57.978 --> 00:13:02.581
how can I go on clipping them back?

00:13:03.118 --> 00:13:08.570
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.777
you have the enjoyment of it.

00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:19.073
Now if it's a, say, a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example.

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:24.273
But then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:30.433
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

00:13:30.634 --> 00:13:34.460
and all sorts of nonsense that's going on.

00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:39.065
So I again say that, now we are going to Pune

00:13:39.266 --> 00:13:43.098
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed.

00:13:43.328 --> 00:13:46.135
If you go on like this there's no end to it,

00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:51.319
also those people who come for marriages and deny it twice,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.923
third time I don't ask them,

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:58.338
because it's a joke going on.

00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:04.967
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.729
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.933
Yesterday you saw that.

00:14:11.134 --> 00:14:14.021
You have different conditionings,

00:14:14.222 --> 00:14:17.227
different styles, different everything,

00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:20.778
heights different, ages different, faces different,

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:23.997
aptitudes different.

00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:29.282
So combine all these things, so very difficult.

00:14:29.551 --> 00:14:32.648
Sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:35.299
them better to give you a simple woman,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.333
so that your little pressure is reduced,

00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:43.041
you can share with her but if you are equally educated people,

00:14:43.242 --> 00:14:47.580
then both the heads may be...

00:14:52.937 --> 00:14:57.857
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

00:14:58.058 --> 00:15:00.656
but somehow or other you can defy

00:15:00.857 --> 00:15:03.656
and you try to defy it, alright doesn't matter,

00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:07.402
but who is the loser is the point.

00:15:07.608 --> 00:15:09.915
Today I had to speak to you about this,

00:15:10.132 --> 00:15:14.875
because in Sahaj we have to take the way it comes as it comes.

00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:18.905
Whatever comes in our way we should take it.

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:21.971
We should not sort of say: I've fallen in love.

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:26.882
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:39.244
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:44.847
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:46.777
or something absurd.

00:15:46.978 --> 00:15:48.389
So many people have told me:

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.690
"Mother, I have not fallen in love with her."

00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:56.534
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch, or you may fall,

00:15:57.059 --> 00:16:00.992
fall into some river or something like that.

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:06.238
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:17.308
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

00:16:19.217 --> 00:16:24.566
if it means that you have felt the love,

00:16:24.804 --> 00:16:31.822
or if it means that you have the sensitivity of feeling the love,

00:16:32.023 --> 00:16:34.841
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

00:16:35.042 --> 00:16:37.311
but this falling in love business

00:16:37.512 --> 00:16:39.533
has been going on and on and on.

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:41.126
Now I would request you

00:16:41.327 --> 00:16:46.484
that in Sahaja Yoga we cancel this terminology.

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:55.239
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:55.494 --> 00:16:59.482
You got chance for one month to decide for yourself

00:16:59.683 --> 00:17:01.757
and to find out for yourself.

00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.004
Little bit adjustments and understanding

00:17:05.205 --> 00:17:10.041
can create such a beautiful world for you.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:16.054
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:18.852
suddenly you're alright I find,

00:17:19.061 --> 00:17:22.163
at the spur of the moment I find suddenly: "No",

00:17:22.364 --> 00:17:23.410
I say: "What's this?"

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:26.136
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.385
it has turned round?

00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:30.161
One can understand a horse,

00:17:30.362 --> 00:17:33.610
but I can't understand human beings.

00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:38.786
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:44.513
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.611
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

00:17:48.812 --> 00:17:50.638
from all over the country,

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:54.462
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

00:17:54.663 --> 00:17:55.904
that has gone rotten,

00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:57.573
while I'm boasting to everyone

00:17:57.774 --> 00:17:59.615
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

00:17:59.816 --> 00:18:02.529
I know it's not true,

00:18:02.934 --> 00:18:07.652
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:12.571
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

00:18:12.928 --> 00:18:16.930
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:21.085
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:25.136
to bring about these events.

00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:29.523
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

00:18:29.724 --> 00:18:34.370
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

00:18:34.902 --> 00:18:38.009
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.738
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:44.740
after that, we are enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

00:18:45.034 --> 00:18:48.814
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost.

00:18:49.015 --> 00:18:52.533
That also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:56.679
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.625
its such a headache.

00:19:02.749 --> 00:19:06.660
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

00:19:06.861 --> 00:19:10.034
because I think there's no problem at all.

00:19:10.235 --> 00:19:14.202
Only thing you have decided not to enjoy anything.

00:19:15.934 --> 00:19:18.819
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food,

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.508
you can put some quinine on your tongue

00:19:21.709 --> 00:19:23.220
and then say I don't like the food,

00:19:23.421 --> 00:19:27.518
something like that. It's absurd.

00:19:27.718 --> 00:19:30.021
So try to help me in this,

00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:33.570
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.102
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:41.582
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:48.046
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:52.058
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.393
What are you?

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:59.024
What is your education? What is your intellect?

00:19:59.286 --> 00:20:02.010
What do you expect from another person?

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:03.641
How much money you have got?

00:20:03.842 --> 00:20:05.402
How much money the other person has got?

00:20:05.603 --> 00:20:09.781
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself, to begin with,

00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:12.542
then compare.

00:20:12.959 --> 00:20:14.919
But the greatest thing you have to think about,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.487
how many vibrations you have?

00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:24.375
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

00:20:24.576 --> 00:20:27.069
You are married for your ascent.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:33.939
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.907
then your should not unnecessarily boast of nonsensical gross things.

00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:44.706
The person is much subtler, make use of that.

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:49.639
Whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:53.369
but I just say that see for yourself," where are you?"

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:57.011
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:57.212 --> 00:20:59.634
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

00:20:59.835 --> 00:21:03.442
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

00:21:04.076 --> 00:21:07.746
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

00:21:07.947 --> 00:21:11.503
we have to work, we have to save that person,

00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:16.828
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:22.325
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

00:21:23.564 --> 00:21:26.297
I think you will understand the seriousness,

00:21:26.498 --> 00:21:28.878
this is the most important work

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:33.727
that ever happened on this Earth so far.

00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:36.640
Your marriages are very important

00:21:36.841 --> 00:21:38.614
and you have seen the photographs

00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:42.168
where the Gods themselves have blessed you.

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:45.635
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

00:21:45.836 --> 00:21:48.010
they all were present in your marriage

00:21:48.211 --> 00:21:51.759
and how they were giving you tributes

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.509
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.731
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

00:22:01.262 --> 00:22:03.283
But if you are not a seeker,

00:22:03.484 --> 00:22:05.775
and if you are not seeking your higher ascent,

00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:09.471
then you go into nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

00:22:09.672 --> 00:22:13.189
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.494
don't think too much of yourself.

00:22:15.695 --> 00:22:18.169
Another note of caution,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:23.523
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

00:22:23.724 --> 00:22:26.234
so don't get mad.

00:22:26.472 --> 00:22:29.933
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

00:22:30.134 --> 00:22:33.461
It's done in India to create better relationships,

00:22:33.662 --> 00:22:36.489
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.290
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

00:22:42.607 --> 00:22:44.476
so better be careful.

00:22:44.694 --> 00:22:47.520
It's a custom here to look after the son-in-law,

00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:51.126
to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:54.306
Now it is ingrained from ages,

00:22:54.507 --> 00:22:56.898
it doesn't mean that you are God,

00:22:57.099 --> 00:23:00.936
or you are in some superlative condition.

00:23:01.939 --> 00:23:05.917
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:08.385
they look after the daughter-in-law,

00:23:08.586 --> 00:23:11.958
or the son-in-law, normally.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:16.173
And you should not carry away ideas,

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:19.235
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

00:23:19.436 --> 00:23:20.785
I have seen, they don't care.

00:23:20.986 --> 00:23:24.365
Once that they are married, they are finished, it's not so,

00:23:24.566 --> 00:23:25.864
so please be careful.

00:23:26.065 --> 00:23:27.434
When you are marrying Indians,

00:23:27.635 --> 00:23:31.888
you will find the parents will quite pamper you, look after you,

00:23:32.089 --> 00:23:35.573
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:40.215
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

00:23:40.739 --> 00:23:46.270
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:48.395
and should not get pampered,

00:23:48.596 --> 00:23:51.101
on the contrary should feel blissful about it.

00:23:51.302 --> 00:23:54.907
But when it is done I have seen suddenly they go off

00:23:55.108 --> 00:23:57.018
and they think no end of themselves,

00:23:57.219 --> 00:24:00.117
their value system goes off.

00:24:00.318 --> 00:24:04.011
It's because, so far we have had no education,

00:24:04.212 --> 00:24:07.767
no training about marriages.

00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:11.223
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:14.951
But indians also you see, expect you to understand

00:24:15.151 --> 00:24:16.820
their customs sometimes too much.

00:24:17.035 --> 00:24:19.583
For example yesterday the garlands were given

00:24:19.784 --> 00:24:21.711
at the time when the garlands were given,

00:24:21.911 --> 00:24:25.192
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

00:24:25.454 --> 00:24:28.353
but some of you took the garland put it in you.

00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:32.256
They regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:34.020
but it is so.

00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:38.382
So when we are in India we have to understand Indians,

00:24:38.565 --> 00:24:42.061
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

00:24:42.262 --> 00:24:44.778
For example in the west you just go on saying,

00:24:44.979 --> 00:24:48.374
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry.

00:24:48.772 --> 00:24:51.125
It is so confusing sometimes.

00:24:51.326 --> 00:24:54.415
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

00:24:54.616 --> 00:24:58.459
I mean, I sometimes shake hands with nine hundred people at a time.

00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:02.293
And while they are going back again nine hundred people.

00:25:02.884 --> 00:25:05.213
I think namaste is a better idea,

00:25:05.414 --> 00:25:08.373
than to shake hands with every sort of a person,

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:12.188
you'll catch from every one. But it's a custom,

00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:15.392
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:20.197
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

00:25:20.626 --> 00:25:24.953
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

00:25:25.154 --> 00:25:27.807
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

00:25:28.008 --> 00:25:31.626
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.054
and the ladies don't take garlands on their...,

00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:38.038
you see because any man cannot garland a lady,

00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:40.738
because it's only husband has the right,

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:43.337
see, so anyone won't garland.

00:25:43.538 --> 00:25:46.476
Or a son can garland the mother,

00:25:46.774 --> 00:25:49.753
but any man cannot garland any lady

00:25:49.954 --> 00:25:51.857
who is of a younger age,

00:25:52.058 --> 00:25:55.678
or who is not yet married and even if married,

00:25:55.879 --> 00:25:59.426
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright.

00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:03.639
So these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.948
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street.

00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:13.043
Even if the leaders here are garlanded

00:26:13.244 --> 00:26:16.247
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

00:26:16.448 --> 00:26:20.799
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.169
So these are few customs which must be understood

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.966
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic.

00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:32.121
Whatever is illogical we can give up,

00:26:32.322 --> 00:26:36.007
whatever is logical we have to take it and understand it.

00:26:36.238 --> 00:26:38.892
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.043
children also started laughing, because they thought

00:26:41.244 --> 00:26:43.695
they are garlanding themselves.

00:26:43.896 --> 00:26:48.561
It's like doing aarti to yourself, you know,

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.246
amounts to that.

00:26:51.587 --> 00:26:54.716
So you can understand why they were laughing.

00:26:54.917 --> 00:26:59.816
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

00:27:00.636 --> 00:27:04.506
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.334
yesterday was Left Vishuddhi was too much.

00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:11.585
Perhaps maybe in the morning I said you were allready late

00:27:11.786 --> 00:27:15.062
for the formal programme, I don't know.

00:27:15.263 --> 00:27:18.949
Whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.577
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

00:27:21.778 --> 00:27:23.457
in any formal programme.

00:27:23.658 --> 00:27:28.298
But it seems such a Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:30.561
and I just knew what it was.

00:27:30.785 --> 00:27:33.164
So Mother says to you things

00:27:33.365 --> 00:27:35.415
which should not hurt you in any way

00:27:35.616 --> 00:27:37.746
and you should not take it that seriously

00:27:37.947 --> 00:27:40.571
but should understand that next time we should not do so,

00:27:40.772 --> 00:27:44.231
otherwise you are all wonderful people, you are beautiful people.

00:27:44.525 --> 00:27:46.447
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:48.466
but I am very proud of you.

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.407
I'm extremely proud of you,

00:27:50.608 --> 00:27:52.791
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

00:27:52.992 --> 00:27:56.811
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

00:27:57.012 --> 00:28:00.404
I don't know what should I do.

00:28:00.832 --> 00:28:04.205
So not to take things that seriously.

00:28:04.939 --> 00:28:08.421
There's nothing so much wrong.

00:28:08.659 --> 00:28:11.786
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

00:28:11.987 --> 00:28:14.478
it's for our good, for our enjoyment.

00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:17.304
Everything to increase your enjoyment.

00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:21.612
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

00:28:21.813 --> 00:28:26.367
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

00:28:26.685 --> 00:28:29.508
all this is done.

00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:34.479
