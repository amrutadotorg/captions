00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:07,101
Shri Adi Shakti Puja
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 25 May 1997

2
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:18,062
Today we are going to do the puja
of Adi Shakti.

3
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:31,239
It’s a difficult subject to talk about
Adi Shakti

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:42,393
because it’s not easy to understand

5
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:48,887
that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva.

6
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:55,135
Sadashiva is the God Almighty.

7
00:00:56,158 --> 00:01:00,310
She is His breath, as they some people
call it.

8
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:04,910
Some say She is the desire

9
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:16,709
and some say that She’s the entire power
of Sadashiva,

10
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:26,656
and Sadashiva cannot do anything without
Her powers.

11
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:39,261
This subject has been described by many
people in various books in different ways.

12
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:46,341
But actually we need not go

13
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:50,800
to the background of the creation
of Adi Shakti,

14
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:57,830
for that at least you’ll need seven
lectures. But we’ll come to the point

15
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:03,623
where Adi Shakti started working on this
Mother Earth.

16
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:07,835
The first thing is we must know,

17
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:13,783
that She created a Kundalini in the Mother
Earth itself

18
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:23,719
and She created Shri Ganesha out of
the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,443
So the Mother Earth becomes a very
important thing for us.

20
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:34,004
If we do not know how to respect the Mother
Earth,

21
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:40,190
we do not know how to respect ourselves.

22
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:45,887
The expression of Adi Shakti within you
is the Kundalini, no doubt.

23
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:50,946
That is the reflection of Adi Shakti
in you.

24
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:57,318
But the reflection in the Mother Earth is
also expressed,

25
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:06,733
as you all know, in different places,
different countries, different cities,

26
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:15,954
as the manifestation of chakras and
Adi Shakti’s creations.

27
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:24,884
It was very important first to create
a very holy Mother Earth

28
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:29,237
for human beings to be born on that.

29
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:41,032
So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as
Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth.

30
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:49,618
Kundalini is a, we should say, is a wee
part of the Adi Shakti,

31
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:58,957
or we can say that She is the desire,
pure desire of the Adi Shakti.

32
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,276
So Adi Shakti is the desire, complete
desire of Sadashiva

33
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:18,548
and Kundalini, Adi Kundalini, is the desire,
complete desire of Adi Shakti.

34
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:23,208
Now this one was first expressed

35
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:30,326
in the Mother Earth, inside the Mother
Earth.

36
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:37,500
Inside the Mother Earth, the Kundalini
came up

37
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:45,374
in such a way that it cooled down the inner
part of the Mother Earth

38
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:48,999
as much as it could,

39
00:04:50,085 --> 00:05:02,335
and then it manifested on the surface
of the earth as different chakras.

40
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:12,080
So it’s tremendous similarity that we have

41
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:20,350
with Virata, the Mother Earth and the human
beings.

42
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:34,073
If all of them are being reflected by
the Adi Kundalini,

43
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:40,257
so there has to be a great connection
between them.

44
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:50,865
It is not understood by human beings how
they are connected to this Mother Earth.

45
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:56,330
This Kundalini passed through different
centers, creating different centers

46
00:05:56,531 --> 00:06:04,019
in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke
through Kailasha.

47
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,878
And I don’t know how many have you been
to Kailash you’ll see

48
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,075
tremendous vibrations flowing out
of Kailash.

49
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:20,030
Now the way we insult our Mother Earth,

50
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:27,999
what we are doing is we are insulting
the Adi Shakti.

51
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:34,327
So many ways there are we should respect
the Mother Earth.

52
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:42,478
I mean it was an Indian custom to begin
with, when you got up from your bed

53
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:46,559
and you touched the Mother Earth with
your feet,

54
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,584
you have to say, “Oh Mother Earth, please
forgive me

55
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:56,290
because I’m touching you with my feet”.

56
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:07,436
All the movements of Mother Earth are
controlled by this inner Kundalini,

57
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:11,477
which is the reflection of Adi Shakti.

58
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:17,555
The gravity that it has also is
the manifestation

59
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:23,486
of the Kundalini of the Mother Earth.

60
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:33,070
Now, why we are suffering in this beautiful
planet,

61
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:39,719
because we do not respect what we have
to respect the most.

62
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,110
Mother Earth is to be respected, meaning
what?

63
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:54,326
Meaning that whatever is created on this
earth, by the movement of the earth,

64
00:07:54,527 --> 00:08:01,685
by the sea, by all the elements, has to be
respected.

65
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:10,608
Today’s problem is pollution, all kinds
of things people talk of.

66
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:15,763
The reason behind it, people never
understood the importance

67
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:23,656
of all these five elements which are
supportive of our life.

68
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:28,699
So to respect the Mother Earth people do
Bhumi Puja.

69
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,226
Many people, when they are building
a house,

70
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:37,222
they will do the Bhumi Pujan, means they
will respect the Mother Earth,

71
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:43,449
because if She is not being respected maybe
there could be an earthquake,

72
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:53,766
which means that this Mother Earth
understands, knows and acts.

73
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:02,684
It acts in such a manner that human beings
don’t understand why such things happen.

74
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:09,367
Now, we can say that, in a place called
Latur,

75
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:20,539
it was Shri Ganesha’s fourteenth day and
they had to submerge

76
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:30,584
the statues into the sea or into the river,
so they went all out, singing, dancing.

77
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:35,923
After coming from there they all started
drinking,

78
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:43,525
and drinking is not liked by Mother Earth
at all.

79
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:49,382
If you are drunk and you are walking
on the road you’ll fall down.

80
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:59,895
It so happened with their drinking that
a big earthquake broke in,

81
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:04,965
and all those who were dancing, were
drinking, all of them

82
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:10,432
were engulfed into that earthquake by
Mother Earth.

83
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:18,427
Only our center, which is there, was
surrounded by a big gap

84
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:27,787
 but nothing happened to our center and not
one single Sahaja Yogi was ruined by that.

85
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:33,883
We can understand because we are Sahaja
Yogis, how the Mother Earth has acted

86
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:38,660
to save those people, who were Sahaja
Yogis.

87
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:45,766
So the understanding of Mother Earth about
saints is very great.

88
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:54,493
She knows who is a saint, She knows
the feet of a saint

89
00:10:54,694 --> 00:11:00,847
and that’s why, you know so many things
were created, like Moses,

90
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:07,091
He went to the sea and the Mother Earth
came up, for them to walk through.

91
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:14,659
If all the Jews had walked, it would not
have worked, but it was Moses

92
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,653
and His saintliness that the Mother Earth
Herself came up and helped.

93
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:32,373
In the same way when Rama was building
a big bridge between Lanka and India,

94
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:36,748
the Mother Earth came up as a bridge.

95
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:44,671
So we should not try to curse the Mother
Earth for any mishaps on this Earth.

96
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:50,708
If people are saintly they will be always
protected by Mother Earth.

97
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:56,606
She will always try to give them whatever
they want.

98
00:11:56,807 --> 00:12:03,444
You can see in the minute way, that
supposing now, in our Cabella here,

99
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:09,193
the roses are of such a big size, such
a big size roses,

100
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:15,928
you won’t find such big size in the whole
world. But we have here, such big ones.

101
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:21,004
In Pratisthan we had

102
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:28,327
flowers of sunflower so big as that.
One man could not lift it.

103
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:33,874
Now, how is it all this is happening
in particular places?

104
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:39,319
Is the Mother Earth who knows who is living
here,

105
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:48,712
who is walking on Her back we should say,
or on Her soil,

106
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:53,703
because Mother Earth understands
vibrations.

107
00:12:53,904 --> 00:13:01,262
Now, certain places we say that are very
holy.

108
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:14,734
How have they discovered that these places
are holy, because of magnetic forces.

109
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:19,941
The magnetic forces in England I was
surprised, were crossing each other

110
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:23,072
at a place called Oxted where we lived.

111
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:27,866
They were crossing since long, but we lived
there later on.

112
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:37,253
So Mother Earth also organizes and arranges
things for saintly people.

113
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:44,063
It's very interesting to see how the Mother
Earth guides you in a proper way.

114
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:47,214
I mean, I don't know how many instances
I can give you.

115
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:52,940
But we don’t understand the value of
the understanding of this Mother Earth

116
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:59,214
and Her loving protection for all
he saints.

117
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:06,262
In the same way, we have to understand how
the whole atmosphere, the rain,

118
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:10,504
comes in at the right time, the moon,
the sun,

119
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:17,578
everything works out in such a beautiful
manner because they know it’s a saint.

120
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:24,902
They know these are saintly people sitting
here. They know that they are pure people,

121
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:31,711
that they are the essence of life and they
should be looked after,

122
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:36,160
they should be cared for, they should be
bothered for.

123
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:42,604
It is not bothered about people who are
of no use.

124
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:49,302
For example now for Haj, so many people
went and so many were killed.

125
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:54,360
Some went to Amarnath and they were killed
because they were not saints,

126
00:14:54,561 --> 00:15:00,138
just ritualistic people, going for a ritual
which,

127
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:09,520
in the discretion of the Mother Earth, was
of no avail and of no advantage to them.

128
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:13,059
But nobody learns from this, nobody learns.

129
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:17,246
When so many people were going to say,
Amarnath were killed,

130
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:21,787
Pakistan said, “See, they should not have
gone to this Amarnath,

131
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:28,056
it’s a false place, why did they go there?
And by going there

132
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:32,701
what has proved is that it’s not a holy
place”.

133
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:36,647
But when the Haj thing took place, they had
nothing to say,

134
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:39,898
they didn’t know how to explain this
Haj business

135
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:44,872
and the killing – dying of so many people.

136
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:52,597
The reason is this, that these people have
been going to Haj all the time.

137
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:56,620
Once there was a stampede with thirty-two
thousand people being

138
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:01,278
injured and troubled and killed. Now this
is it.

139
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:09,589
Now, what is Mother Earth suggesting, that
going to these places,

140
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:16,465
holy places, they are really holy, no doubt;
going to these places,

141
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,831
you are not doing any spiritual ascent.

142
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:28,258
You are not achieving anything by going
to these places, which are really holy.

143
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,317
That cannot be challenged. They are holy
places.

144
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:37,370
You must be knowing that I was born
in Chindwara, and Mecca and Chindwara

145
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:43,012
are on the same Cancer line. How is it?

146
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:50,182
What is about Mecca? Mecca is
Makkeshwarashiv – it’s a Shiva.

147
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:56,963
Why did Mohammed Sahib ask people
to worship a stone?

148
00:16:57,164 --> 00:17:01,912
He didn’t believe in stones, He was against
all kinds of idol worship;

149
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:06,925
then why did He say this black stone,
which is there, has to be worshipped,

150
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,742
for that people have to go there. What was
the reason?

151
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:16,084
Because He could feel the vibrations, He
could feel that it’s a swayambhu,

152
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,137
so He said it. So all the Muslims like mad
are going there.

153
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:26,780
By going there nobody has improved, I have
not seen anybody improved by going to Mecca.

154
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:31,156
It's just a kind of a ritual. They think
if they go there,

155
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:35,346
when they will die tomorrow they will tell
God, “See now, we have a certificate,

156
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:38,476
we have been to Mecca.”

157
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:46,309
Like our pope once upon a time used to give
certificate, that when you go to heaven,

158
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,543
 you can show the certificate that now you
are a real Christian.

159
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:59,696
In this way, all these artificial things
came up, but there is reality behind it.

160
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:06,268
The difference is the reality is for
the real people and not for false people.

161
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,604
But this ritualism has grown too much.

162
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:16,815
Like in India we have many swayambhus
created by the Kundalini again I would say,

163
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:20,213
and which are really worshipped.

164
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:27,134
I’ve been to most of them and I was
surprised that most of the pujaris

165
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:32,404
were suffering from some sort of a serious
disease. Like one was a paralyzed fellow.

166
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:36,829
He said, “We are serving this God here,
and You said this is swayambhu;

167
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,553
then Mother, how, why is it we are
suffering from this disease?”

168
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:45,549
I said, “Because you are just making money.
You can’t make money out of God.

169
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,141
If you don’t want to serve God, you don’t
stay here, but if you want to serve God,

170
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:55,330
then you can stay here, but don’t make
money out of this”.

171
00:18:55,531 --> 00:19:02,610
It’s very common, I have seen, those people
who make money get paralysis, I’ve seen it.

172
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:12,370
It’s a very deep understanding all these
elements, Mother Earth,

173
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:17,322
everybody has about everything.

174
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:23,529
Because their Kundalini is not like your
Kundalini,

175
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:33,887
which is, though in itself is pure, but
because of your human endeavors,

176
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:39,536
human mistakes, ego, superego, all sorts
of nonsense,

177
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:48,218
the Kundalini is not so sensitive, nor does
it tell you what is happening.

178
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:57,665
It has to be very alert, sensitive
spirituality within you,

179
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:04,919
by which you can say immediately what you
think,

180
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,903
what you know, what you understand about
anything.

181
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:15,757
But the problem is that this doesn’t exist.

182
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:20,990
Why is it you should not be so sensitive?

183
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:25,663
On the contrary, I have seen, if their
mind works against somebody,

184
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:28,501
then they start saying, “You are catching
on this, you are catching on that,

185
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:34,120
you are catching on that”. Actually
the person who’s saying that is catching.

186
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:40,300
So with this thing one has to understand
that if we are the true reflection

187
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:51,812
of Adi Shakti, then we should be pure,
absolutely pure, like the white snow.

188
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:57,007
Even one black drop – that’s why I wore
today the white sari -

189
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,026
falls on the white, it shows.

190
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:11,740
You should be so white that anything,
any minute black spot

191
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:21,590
also should be seen by you, and in others
also to be felt by you.

192
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:36,698
If that height is achieved by pure life,
by pure thinking, by pure heart,

193
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:42,814
it is not necessary to manipulate anything;
no, no need at all.

194
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:50,104
It’s all natural like the Mother Earth is.
Does She manipulate anything? Nothing.

195
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:55,322
Just see how spontaneous She is. You put
a seed in the Mother Earth

196
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:59,434
and see how it sprouts.

197
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:05,458
She is so spontaneous, Her activity is so
spontaneous, we never wonder about it.

198
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,702
See different types of flowers, different
types of fragrance,

199
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:14,045
different types of shrubs and trees,

200
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:19,532
how She grows with such balance in every
place.

201
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:29,066
In every minute atom and molecule of that
Mother Earth there is sense.

202
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:38,876
So before us is the best reflection of the
Adi Shakti and that is this Mother Earth.

203
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:42,257
So first we must respect the Mother Earth.

204
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,102
I like you people because you are sitting
on the ground, it’s very good.

205
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:51,046
For meditation if you can sit on the Mother
Earth it will be extremely good

206
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:56,291
because the special quality of the Mother
Earth, which also I have unfortunately,

207
00:22:56,492 --> 00:23:03,600
that I suck your problems. She too sucks
your problem

208
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:09,334
and when She sucks your problem you get
rid of them without any difficulties.

209
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:16,696
So, if you cannot, say, sit on the ground,
then you take a stone, better is,

210
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:23,123
or you can have a marble, or something which
is natural on which you should try to sit.

211
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:27,564
But if you sit on the plastic and do your
meditation, I don’t know

212
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:31,446
what is going to help you – the plastic?

213
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:36,210
That’s why I request you always, that use
natural things,

214
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:43,597
because natural things can absorb your
problems very well.

215
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,345
Unnaturally also we live otherwise.

216
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:51,377
You see it is on the physical line, also
on mental line.

217
00:23:51,578 --> 00:24:00,669
On mental line what do we do, that we go on
arguing, explaining,

218
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,810
it’s going on and on and on and on! There’s
no end to it.

219
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:11,387
One should get headache, you see, actually
with all that. But if you are spontaneous,

220
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:15,729
if you are very spontaneous, immediately
you will know

221
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:21,364
what the other fellow is trying to do or
to say or to communicate.

222
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,854
You don’t need much thinking about it,

223
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:28,527
because you can absorb even the thought
of another person.

224
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:33,573
Absorb doesn’t mean that you take the bad
thing of that person,

225
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:39,933
but it’s like the sieving out. You absorb
what another person is saying

226
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:43,000
and you sieve it out.

227
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:51,199
Now the problem of this Adi Shakti is this,
that I decided

228
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:59,088
that I will have all of you enter into
My body, absorb all of you.

229
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:03,375
It’s a very dangerous game I know, but
I did play,

230
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:08,232
because I’m supposed to do at this stage
of time,

231
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:12,178
that I should absorb you all in My body.

232
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:16,415
So with you, all your problems are also
gone into Me,

233
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:19,598
all your troubles also have gone into Me.

234
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,137
But by absorbing it, see, it’s like ocean
into which you are put

235
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:33,501
and you are cleansed. But what about
the ocean?

236
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:40,637
Ocean has got still your problems and things
lingering and they are very troublesome.

237
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:46,317
So the best thing would be for you
to cleanse yourself.

238
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:51,703
Cleansing is very important through
introspection.

239
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:55,169
But doesn’t mean thinking, never means
thinking.

240
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,844
But introspection means meditation and that
you all should meditate.

241
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:05,575
I must tell you, we had a meeting
of the leaders

242
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:09,438
and they came out and sat in the drawing
room.

243
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:14,146
As soon as they assembled I had such
a severe pain in the stomach

244
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:20,062
and I had such a bad diarrhea that you
can’t believe.

245
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:24,891
Now, who has got those problems, I don’t
know.

246
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:32,447
Who has brought these problems, I don’t
know.

247
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:39,513
But as a Mother, as a Mother, I don’t mind
anything,

248
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:43,750
as long as you all get well and purified.

249
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:48,735
Just like as the Mother Earth cares for you,
I also care for you.

250
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:53,096
And just like as the Mother Earth loves you,
I also love you,

251
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:56,516
whether you are bad or good is not
the point.

252
00:26:56,717 --> 00:27:03,634
But to be kind to Me if you could try to be
really good Sahaja Yogis,

253
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:09,338
not a showoffs, not business-like, not only
thinking type,

254
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,220
not argumentative, not criticizing others;

255
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:18,209
if you just try to meditate every day ten
to fifteen minutes,

256
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:24,181
I tell you, My health will be first class.
Because I have taken your injections inside

257
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:28,693
and they start torturing My life for nothing
at all.

258
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:34,582
See so, now, it’s a risk I have run, and
I am sure you are all very sensible people,

259
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:38,977
and you will understand that your Mother
shouldn’t suffer.

260
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:42,318
This is every-day crucifixion for Me
sometimes you know,

261
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:48,190
and I don’t know what to say. For example,
the other day in Delhi,

262
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:52,089
one gentleman who is a leader, came to Me,
to see Me,

263
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,590
and My one foot started going like that
and paining so much.

264
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:59,667
I mean I didn’t know what to tell him that,
“You get out now,”

265
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:02,059
because I just can’t hurt him, you know.

266
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:06,139
But I said, “What’s the matter, where have
you been, what did you do?”

267
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,619
And so he realized and he went out, and
really it improved.

268
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,687
Nearness also, I think, has an effect,
because if a man like that is,

269
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:22,905
or a lady like that is full of problems and
she comes

270
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:31,132
very much closer to My attention, then I
have to take up the cross, it’s like this.

271
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:37,395
A very simple understanding should be that,
“Why are we in Sahaja Yoga?”.

272
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:44,865
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend, to go
higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

273
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:50,880
It was very entertaining yesterday the way
you talked about your

274
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:58,877
ambition to be higher and higher. Really
it was very joy-giving, no doubt.

275
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:05,159
But what are we doing about it, what are
we trying about it, we should see.

276
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,485
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,

277
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:14,928
are we all doing something to elevate
others also,

278
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,966
to give realizations to others? Specially
women I have seen,

279
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:23,996
don’t do much of this, which is very bad,
because you are the mothers.

280
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:28,415
You have to go all out to give realizations
to others.

281
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:34,277
But men are more active that way and women
are not. So it works the other way round.

282
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:40,392
Now on one side the men are, I think are
active but don’t meditate.

283
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:45,919
Women meditate and men do the outside work,
it’s sort of a part-time,

284
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:54,084
or you can call it a good labor division
that, “You meditate at home

285
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:57,488
and we’ll go all out”. It’s not going
to work out.

286
00:29:57,689 --> 00:30:04,702
So one has to meditate and one has to also
go out

287
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:10,197
to spread Sahaja Yoga.  Both things have
to be done.

288
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:16,775
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t
spread Sahaja Yoga, you will never ascend.

289
00:30:16,976 --> 00:30:22,659
Because after all this Kundalini, you see,
She’s a sensible woman, na,

290
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,820
She’s very sensible. She thinks, “Why
should I make her a saint?

291
00:30:30,021 --> 00:30:35,331
What is the use?”. Sahaja Yoga is not
individualistic,

292
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:41,761
it’s not for one person to become a saint
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

293
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:46,320
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

294
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:50,830
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective
happening.

295
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:54,097
So if you are not helping to
the collective,

296
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,807
Kundalini says, “All right, you are
all right as it is”, just like our body.

297
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:03,259
See, in our body if one organ says,
“All right, now I am all right,

298
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,164
I am not going to work out”, or one cell
says that, “I am not going to now grow,

299
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:12,226
it’s all right. Why should I worry about
the whole body?”, it won’t work.

300
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:16,940
It’s a living, it’s a living organism,
I have told you hundred times,

301
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:25,437
when it is a living organism it has to grow,
it has to grow and also to absorb.

302
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,414
To have energy you have to meditate and
you have to grow.

303
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:33,955
If you don’t grow, you are finished. You
are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

304
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:41,083
I wouldn’t call a person a Sahaja Yogi who
has not even given one person realization.

305
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:46,862
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi has
to give realizations to others.

306
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:50,893
Apart from other activities, the main
activity should be

307
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,083
how we give realizations to others.

308
00:31:54,284 --> 00:31:59,716
Unless and until we really look after that
side of life

309
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:04,324
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:12,661
For example now, take My position. I’m
all right, I’m complete, I have no problem.

311
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:21,302
But why did I work so hard and wanted
so many Sahaja Yogis, why?

312
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:25,495
What was the - I don’t have to grow either,
I’m overgrown already.

313
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:29,060
I don’t have to do it, but why? What is
the need?

314
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:33,336
The need is like this, the need is of love.

315
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:37,637
I have so much love that I have
to channelize it.

316
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:42,714
If I don’t I’ll suffocate, I can’t love
Myself.

317
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:47,777
So this love has to spread. For that I have
to have you people,

318
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:52,076
who can take this love to others and make
them happy.

319
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:57,399
This is a kind of a vision I have,

320
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,992
and in this special time, it was promised
by many people, by many saints,

321
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:11,948
and it is so obvious that you are all
specially chosen for this kind of thing.

322
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:17,849
Now how far you understand your importance
is a different point.

323
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:29,207
You do for your emancipation, all right,
you meditate.

324
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:36,410
But if you are not channelizing the love,
the Divine love, what is the use?

325
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:40,278
Now supposing I repair something very
nicely:

326
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:45,379
I repair this machine nicely, put it right,
everything, and I don’t speak,

327
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,857
what’s the use of having this?

328
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:54,111
In the same way, if you work very hard,
I know people who get up at four o’clock,

329
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:57,354
have their baths, do meditation,

330
00:33:57,555 --> 00:34:02,076
sit down, in the night again they sit down
for meditation.

331
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:08,371
But they never go out, they never talk
to others, they never spread Sahaja Yoga.

332
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:15,971
They do not give Divine love to others, so
how can this great problem of this world

333
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:22,221
be solved, that it has no love? It has
never known Divine love.

334
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:28,355
It has to be given to them.

335
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:37,883
They have to feel this Divine love, this
power of Adi Shakti.

336
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:43,145
They have to know it. Otherwise you have
been selfish, I would say,

337
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:49,741
that you had a nice time having all this
and you have not given it to others.

338
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:54,375
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga
sometimes fails

339
00:34:54,576 --> 00:35:00,012
to create a proper balanced personality
in a human being.

340
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:04,287
Some people are like this, that now
supposing

341
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:09,104
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja
Yogi, take a position like that.

342
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:14,678
Now My desire is that they should develop
a complete understanding of each other,

343
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:22,212
love for each other, but love for Sahaja
Yoga and for others.

344
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:30,242
This is the only way we can justify
marriage in Sahaja Yoga,

345
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:36,350
otherwise why should they marry? But
doesn’t happen like that.

346
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:42,927
What happens is once they are married then
either they will quarrel,

347
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:47,811
they will ask for divorce; if that doesn’t
happen luckily,

348
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,381
because in Sahaja Yoga so easy to get
married, you know.

349
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:57,642
If that doesn’t happen, then they start
having their own family,

350
00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:06,185
 their own homes, they are again becoming
very small, very, very small, very limited.

351
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:10,337
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

352
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:14,274
You have to realize your responsibility.

353
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:19,283
See this Mother Earth, how She knows
Her responsibility.

354
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:26,024
She’s just made out of nothing but soil,
some mud, but look at Her.

355
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:31,067
How She is conscious, how She is
particular, how She works it out,

356
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:34,300
how She is attentive, how She is careful.

357
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:39,866
While you, though you have been blessed
so much by everything

358
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:44,938
you are, are you thinking of giving it
to others?

359
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:51,495
With twelve disciples, whatever was
the problem of Christianity, I mean

360
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:59,691
it was nothing good job, I must say, but
still Christianity spread out.

361
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:04,349
Islam was not a very good job either,
it spread out.

362
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:11,491
All those bad jobs have spread out so much,
so why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

363
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:15,905
It has to spread, it has to go to various
places.

364
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:20,274
Try and find out where you can go and talk
about it

365
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:25,406
and do something good to others and help
them somehow

366
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:35,877
to rise above this common existence
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

367
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:41,232
The time is very short and I think if you
see the time,

368
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:46,076
the rate at which we are moving is not
proper.

369
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:49,733
We have to be much faster, we have to go
much ahead

370
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:55,331
and we have to create much more Sahaja
Yogis

371
00:37:55,532 --> 00:38:03,775
through our consistent, very intensive
effort.

372
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:10,017
But we - it’s a side issue, you see, it’s
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

373
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:14,151
And this is where we are failing in our
responsibility.

374
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,847
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

375
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:22,296
You might say that, “Mataji, how can we be
like you? After all You are Adi Shakti”.

376
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:25,512
Many people say that. “You are Adi Shakti,
so what,

377
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:28,788
you see, with one finger You can move
things like that”.

378
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:34,941
But why should I? Why should I, what
is the need?

379
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,569
So in that reflection that you are Me,

380
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,584
in that reflection that the Mother Earth
is Me,

381
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:50,531
in that beautiful creation within you,

382
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:58,840
you have to become very sensitive
to the need of the world.

383
00:38:59,122 --> 00:39:03,528
What is the need of the world? Today,
if you fail,

384
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:08,931
the whole thing will fail forever. Only
very few will be there.

385
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:16,191
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja
Yoga, because this love

386
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:21,876
is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed
by you,

387
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:29,829
 but is to be enjoyed by as many possible
in the whole world.

388
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:36,100
So today we have to decide that, as
the children of Adi Shakti,

389
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:41,636
we have to go all out, everywhere, every
corner,

390
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:51,278
we have to shout and we have to tell loudly
what is the time in which we are living,

391
00:39:51,479 --> 00:40:03,471
and what is the responsibility that you
have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.

392
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:07,681
There must be some reason why you are here.

393
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:13,734
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used
to ask Me, “Mother, was I this last life,

394
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:18,758
was I Shivaji last life?” I said, “What’s
the use?

395
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:22,172
You might have been anything, but what are
you today is much higher”.

396
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:27,185
Try to understand. You might be, say,
Napoleon,

397
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:34,277
you might be, say, one of the kings say,
or maybe the queen from somewhere.

398
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:40,149
So what, what did they do? Did they raise
anybody’s Kundalini?

399
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,872
Did they have any power? Even the disciples
of Christ

400
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:50,535
or even Mohammed Sahib’s disciples, anyone
- did they do it?

401
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:55,583
Did they have any understanding
of Kundalini?

402
00:40:55,784 --> 00:41:03,671
Did they have any love for others, that
they should give them realization?

403
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:07,659
There were some Sufis, they never gave
realization to anyone.

404
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,311
There were so many saints who never gave
realization to anybody.

405
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:14,303
Mohammed Sahib never gave realization
to anybody.

406
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:18,632
Gautam Buddha never gave realization
to anybody, think of it.

407
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:22,643
Christ never gave realization to anybody.
Anybody.

408
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:29,211
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not. Nobody
- but you can do it!

409
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:36,182
You can do it and you know everything about
Kundalini.

410
00:41:36,383 --> 00:41:42,812
It’s a very big thing because you are
children of the Adi Shakti.

411
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:47,255
You are here and your Mother is here.

412
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:54,395
It’s a very, very fortunate thing for Me
that you are here.

413
00:41:54,596 --> 00:42:00,307
I’m very proud of you, but again and again
I have to tell you that

414
00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:06,774
the work has to be with a faster speed,
we have to move with a faster speed

415
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,056
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

416
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:17,009
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say
something forcefully,

417
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:22,739
that’s not My nature you know. Can’t get
into tempers and cannot get angry,

418
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:30,050
and I cannot forcefully say something
to you, but if you fail,

419
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:35,783
then only thing will be that you have
failed Me completely.

420
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:41,288
It means that, nothing less than that, and
if you don’t want to do it,

421
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:46,884
then I would request all of you to take a
vow today that you will spread Sahaja Yoga

422
00:42:47,085 --> 00:42:50,483
and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga, know
about Sahaj Yog.

423
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:53,255
There are many who don’t know anything.

424
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:57,156
Also it’s very surprising they are Sahaja
Yogis, they don’t know anything.

425
00:42:57,357 --> 00:43:01,127
And don’t create problems for Me, like
marriage:

426
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,366
“We can’t now live now with the wife,
we can’t live with the husband”.

427
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:10,117
All sorts of nonsensical problems people
create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

428
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,100
Are you here to create problems, or
to remove problems of people?

429
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:20,757
So on the whole we have done well I must
say, but it’s not the final.

430
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:26,983
We have to work faster with more enthusiasm
and joyfully.

431
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:31,193
You don’t know what joy you get when you
give realization to somebody.

432
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:37,244
It’s the most joyful moment is when you
give realizations to others.

433
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:41,379
Just try, you must try once, you’ll
enjoy it,

434
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,782
then you’ll want more and more and more.
Now after Sahaja Yoga really

435
00:43:45,983 --> 00:43:51,848
the want disappears into this desire that,
“My God, this man is going,

436
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:53,982
should I call him and give him
realization?”

437
00:43:54,183 --> 00:43:56,510
On the street you will feel like calling
him, “Come here, come here,

438
00:43:56,711 --> 00:44:01,689
I want to give you something”, then make
him sit down, give realization.

439
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,468
This will be your style, like mad - you’ll
say, “Oh no, no, look at this,

440
00:44:06,669 --> 00:44:11,546
this gentleman is without any realization,
let us give him”.

441
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:14,328
You’ll have to go to churches, you’ll have
to go to universities,

442
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:16,733
you have to go to all such congregations

443
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:20,064
where they have no idea about what they
can achieve;

444
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:24,345
and then tell them without any fear,
without any malice.

445
00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:26,965
You can talk to them and you should tell
them,

446
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,601
“Now we are here to help you, for your
good.

447
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:33,421
We have not come for our good but for your
good, now listen to us”.

448
00:44:33,622 --> 00:44:39,710
And I am sure, very sure, that the Kundalini
within you will be very happy.

449
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:45,140
She is not happy you see, She is not happy
with people who are not using her fully.

450
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:50,069
So She will be very happy to help you and
to do the needful

451
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,468
for the emancipation of the whole world.

452
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:56,483
May God bless you.
