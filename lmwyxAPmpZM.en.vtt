Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:05.690
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:15.434
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti,  how

00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:23.606
She had to work out so many things in this world —

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:31.033
first to create and then

00:05:33.454 --> 00:05:37.393
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.936
After that, to comfort.

00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:51.826
Then to counsel.

00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:59.643
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:05.245
They told what was wrong, what was right,

00:06:05.773 --> 00:06:09.313
what should we do, what we should not do,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.813
what is self-respect and what is the

00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:26.349
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

00:06:27.442 --> 00:06:29.346
So many of Them came on this Earth.

00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:34.047
One after another, in every country, They came

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.268
and Their counselling formed religions.

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:43.914
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:47.067
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:53.836
that They formed religions after religions,

00:06:56.491 --> 00:07:01.114
by which only human beings were divided,

00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:08.353
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.889
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:19.125
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:23.155
While Those who came as counsellors

00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:27.325
talked about complete unity,

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:31.147
complete oneness of human race,

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:37.709
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

00:07:38.362 --> 00:07:41.975
did all kinds of wrong things

00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:47.432
and created a country or,

00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:53.996
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

00:07:54.362 --> 00:07:57.777
arising out of religion.

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:05.372
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:10.879
Religion is there to understand love,

00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.247
imbibe love and compassion.

00:08:17.187 --> 00:08:25.076
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:29.955
that is the one Kundalini within us.

00:08:31.697 --> 00:08:39.049
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:44.891
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:48.172
Absolute it is!

00:08:49.088 --> 00:08:53.447
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

00:08:55.626 --> 00:09:00.567
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:06.779
that everything has to be united.

00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:14.977
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:19.205
If that thing starts happening,

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:24.433
all the problems of the world will be finished.

00:09:24.926 --> 00:09:27.714
So the first thing, redemption,

00:09:28.113 --> 00:09:31.462
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:39.444
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

00:09:40.887 --> 00:09:45.579
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:52.770
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:56.997
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

00:09:57.362 --> 00:10:01.443
but actually the all religions are based only

00:10:01.654 --> 00:10:06.523
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:12.194
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:15.416
you start seeking, seeking

00:10:17.377 --> 00:10:21.585
earnest, the Truth.

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:26.524
And the revelation of truth,

00:10:26.945 --> 00:10:32.114
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

00:10:32.274 --> 00:10:34.247
through your reformation

00:10:34.573 --> 00:10:41.203
that you become person who knows the Truth.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.908
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.861
which is your Kundalini.

00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:52.977
And when this thing takes place,

00:10:54.173 --> 00:10:58.609
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

00:11:00.655 --> 00:11:06.357
You become a beautiful human being.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:13.164
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:18.192
it looks like all other small

00:11:21.605 --> 00:11:25.907
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

00:11:26.134 --> 00:11:28.752
small dirty things that are in the pond.

00:11:31.163 --> 00:11:33.944
And then, once it starts coming out,

00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:41.895
coming out of that horrible water,

00:11:43.176 --> 00:11:46.352
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

00:11:47.062 --> 00:11:52.448
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

00:11:52.932 --> 00:11:59.090
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

00:12:00.243 --> 00:12:03.729
but flowers like a lotus.

00:12:04.939 --> 00:12:07.267
It doesn’t have all these insects,

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:12.452
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:17.602
It sucks only the pure water

00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:23.146
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.620
So what is left within you

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:32.418
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:36.510
just like a lotus.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:44.257
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.579
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

00:12:50.218 --> 00:12:53.551
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

00:12:56.923 --> 00:13:00.521
And this state that you have achieved now,

00:13:01.293 --> 00:13:05.914
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

00:13:07.322 --> 00:13:09.672
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

00:13:10.287 --> 00:13:15.846
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

00:13:16.913 --> 00:13:21.168
One can say that it has made lots of money.

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:28.263
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.943
What you get is the satisfaction,

00:13:33.884 --> 00:13:41.729
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:46.801
And the second thing that happens to you,

00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:49.515
you become absolutely collective.

00:13:50.352 --> 00:13:52.550
This has to happen.

00:13:53.523 --> 00:13:59.469
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:05.873
For example, family is very, very weak here.

00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:14.771
Family that has been created by natural relationships

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:19.206
is not so much respected as it should have.

00:14:20.353 --> 00:14:24.957
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:31.285
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:39.873
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

00:14:40.617 --> 00:14:44.692
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:48.997
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

00:14:49.327 --> 00:14:52.985
some people who are working for money,

00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:59.172
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

00:14:59.814 --> 00:15:01.948
who are not so well off.

00:15:02.187 --> 00:15:06.030
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:10.206
looking after the children, building up the families

00:15:10.364 --> 00:15:16.887
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.523
some organization.

00:15:22.114 --> 00:15:26.217
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.414
Why should they think they are something higher

00:15:30.594 --> 00:15:33.140
than the women who are working hard

00:15:33.284 --> 00:15:37.936
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

00:15:38.462 --> 00:15:43.280
bearing all the brunt of the society.

00:15:44.852 --> 00:15:50.542
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

00:15:50.837 --> 00:15:54.703
in America and also Western countries.

00:15:55.683 --> 00:15:58.243
When money becomes important,

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.351
if when money is important,

00:16:01.647 --> 00:16:07.676
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:09.708
Very surprising.

00:16:09.817 --> 00:16:13.489
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:15.917
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:19.345
who is a householder, is not respected.

00:16:20.556 --> 00:16:23.051
And with this, I tell you,

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:28.049
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

00:16:29.016 --> 00:16:32.793
You can work, you can be educated,

00:16:33.153 --> 00:16:37.048
but you should be able to look after your family

00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:42.674
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

00:16:44.021 --> 00:16:47.405
Instead of that, educated women,

00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:50.628
I call them manly women,

00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:55.583
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

00:16:56.729 --> 00:17:00.068
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

00:17:01.122 --> 00:17:04.142
So this kind of a disparity that exists

00:17:04.713 --> 00:17:08.109
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:10.257
We are educated”

00:17:10.676 --> 00:17:13.725
are really manly women, I must say.

00:17:14.563 --> 00:17:18.840
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:23.866
look after the children, look after the family,

00:17:24.183 --> 00:17:28.763
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:32.729
So, such women must be respected

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:36.637
by their husbands, by the men,

00:17:36.962 --> 00:17:39.269
males of the family — not only that,

00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:42.680
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:46.236
who are doing such a difficult task.

00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:50.383
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:54.904
to run the house, to look after the children,

00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:59.310
to look after the complete organization

00:17:59.758 --> 00:18:03.631
and looking after the expenditure

00:18:04.532 --> 00:18:06.963
of the money, if that is limited.

00:18:08.368 --> 00:18:11.744
This ego has to go.

00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:17.188
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:23.131
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:28.828
World of men —I was really laughing.

00:18:29.196 --> 00:18:33.429
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:36.349
Can they exist without women?”

00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:41.643
But I was amazed at her question because she said

00:18:41.784 --> 00:18:46.691
that: “Even in the jail, criminals have so much respect for You,

00:18:47.174 --> 00:18:48.861
how is it possible?

00:18:49.056 --> 00:18:52.893
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:57.450
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.438
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

00:19:03.731 --> 00:19:06.688
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

00:19:07.164 --> 00:19:12.140
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

00:19:13.367 --> 00:19:15.414
That’s the point one should know,

00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:19.807
that woman is a much more important thing

00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:24.559
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

00:19:26.044 --> 00:19:29.852
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:33.574
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:36.155
and create problems.

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:40.784
And mother’s job is not to control.

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:44.960
Her job is to love, to give compassion

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.645
and this is the quality of women is lost

00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:51.804
in these Western, so-called advanced country.

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:56.571
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

00:19:56.881 --> 00:20:01.547
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:07.122
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:12.003
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:15.797
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:21.032
Today, I think it is important to say

00:20:21.473 --> 00:20:25.929
that all of you should understand the value of women

00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:28.199
who are housewives.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.014
It’s a tremendous job

00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:35.391
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

00:20:37.691 --> 00:20:40.835
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:46.662
She will also look after the children.

00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:50.318
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

00:20:50.701 --> 00:20:54.271
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

00:20:55.366 --> 00:20:58.785
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

00:20:59.276 --> 00:21:01.958
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

00:21:02.744 --> 00:21:06.285
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:09.704
you must understand their responsibility.

00:21:11.052 --> 00:21:15.502
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:18.997
all the Western societies are collapsing,

00:21:19.127 --> 00:21:22.812
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

00:21:26.914 --> 00:21:29.799
So, the women should not feel in any way less

00:21:29.994 --> 00:21:32.807
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

00:21:33.002 --> 00:21:35.539
They should not feel inferior to anybody

00:21:35.655 --> 00:21:39.030
who thinks that they are something great.

00:21:40.754 --> 00:21:44.266
Basically, the families have to be good.

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:48.398
This collectivity must work first in the family.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.824
The children are to be groomed properly.

00:21:52.257 --> 00:21:54.780
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:58.047
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:02.439
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

00:22:03.565 --> 00:22:08.194
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

00:22:09.322 --> 00:22:11.840
They are not given any attention.

00:22:12.438 --> 00:22:17.205
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:20.998
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

00:22:21.172 --> 00:22:24.575
because there’s so much, so much neglect

00:22:24.792 --> 00:22:27.864
and so much of hatred for children.

00:22:29.555 --> 00:22:34.019
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.288
you must look after your children.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.736
Not only that, with love and compassion,

00:22:45.954 --> 00:22:52.285
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

00:22:52.718 --> 00:22:57.140
but a person who is a source,

00:22:57.493 --> 00:23:01.070
who is a source of joy and compassion.

00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:06.471
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:10.041
the emotional intelligence.

00:23:13.069 --> 00:23:15.752
That is what we should try to imbibe.

00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:20.144
Emotional intelligence, that means

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.435
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:30.168
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

00:23:30.305 --> 00:23:32.361
our society cannot improve.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.582
In an emotional intelligence, you care

00:23:38.351 --> 00:23:40.678
and you enjoy caring.

00:23:41.602 --> 00:23:46.413
You do everything for others

00:23:47.229 --> 00:23:50.711
with a great emotional understanding.

00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:53.854
Not for one child, not for one son,

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:59.668
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.781
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:08.567
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

00:24:10.243 --> 00:24:15.400
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

00:24:16.042 --> 00:24:20.772
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.462
to give anything to others.

00:24:24.076 --> 00:24:28.799
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

00:24:29.514 --> 00:24:34.323
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

00:24:34.648 --> 00:24:38.585
Why should he do it? Everything for selfishness.

00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:43.042
Then such people indulge into corruption,

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:46.128
indulge into all kinds of things,

00:24:46.323 --> 00:24:50.340
which are only selfish in attitude.

00:24:51.832 --> 00:24:54.487
Now we are talking of collectivity.

00:24:55.186 --> 00:24:58.474
In collectivity, we do for others.

00:24:59.578 --> 00:25:01.820
We enjoy doing for others.

00:25:02.607 --> 00:25:06.601
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:10.323
because your children will also become the same kind

00:25:10.518 --> 00:25:13.006
and they will only bother about themselves.

00:25:15.682 --> 00:25:20.282
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:25.517
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:32.484
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

00:25:33.378 --> 00:25:34.978
Both things are wrong.

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:38.751
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

00:25:39.754 --> 00:25:44.960
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.560
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

00:25:50.174 --> 00:25:52.295
from the collectivity.

00:25:53.173 --> 00:25:57.292
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:02.816
attached to one child, attached to one person,

00:26:03.176 --> 00:26:06.263
to someone, even in the society.

00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:11.023
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

00:26:12.999 --> 00:26:16.013
Why you bothered about one person only?

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.239
All such people fall into such terrible play.

00:26:20.657 --> 00:26:22.841
In the politics you have seen how,

00:26:22.986 --> 00:26:25.142
people try to help their own sons

00:26:25.243 --> 00:26:27.696
and own daughters and this and that.

00:26:27.797 --> 00:26:30.386
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

00:26:30.695 --> 00:26:33.458
kind of an emotional attachment.

00:26:38.548 --> 00:26:43.466
So, according to ethics,

00:26:44.504 --> 00:26:49.561
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

00:26:51.629 --> 00:26:54.854
by which you give to others,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.071
you care for others, for everyone

00:27:01.304 --> 00:27:04.398
and you become very, very collective.

00:27:08.047 --> 00:27:11.926
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.697
that’s very miserly, it’s exclusive.

00:27:15.439 --> 00:27:18.284
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

00:27:18.393 --> 00:27:20.711
You want to be exclusive.

00:27:21.688 --> 00:27:29.296
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:33.040
That is the best thing that you can have.

00:27:33.414 --> 00:27:37.597
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:44.579
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:51.358
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:55.265
I understand about everyone.

00:27:55.922 --> 00:28:01.122
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

00:28:01.476 --> 00:28:06.905
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.614
Whatever you say, I can understand,

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.495
because I am at a level

00:28:13.633 --> 00:28:17.536
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:23.766
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

00:28:24.616 --> 00:28:28.994
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

00:28:31.222 --> 00:28:35.873
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.898
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:47.748
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

00:28:47.885 --> 00:28:53.166
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

00:28:55.747 --> 00:28:59.418
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:03.326
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:05.872
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

00:29:06.766 --> 00:29:09.687
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.292
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

00:29:15.845 --> 00:29:21.139
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

00:29:22.422 --> 00:29:27.485
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

00:29:28.956 --> 00:29:34.344
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:38.540
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

00:29:38.742 --> 00:29:42.319
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

00:29:42.738 --> 00:29:47.324
and even the family gets broken,

00:29:48.175 --> 00:29:51.203
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

00:29:52.253 --> 00:29:54.445
I have known so many women

00:29:54.929 --> 00:29:57.374
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

00:29:57.475 --> 00:29:59.098
I don’t know how they can do it.

00:29:59.335 --> 00:30:03.490
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:09.677
It is something that is a sense of giving.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.545
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:16.420
That’s also another idea,

00:30:16.557 --> 00:30:19.593
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

00:30:20.956 --> 00:30:23.840
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.020
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

00:30:27.901 --> 00:30:30.172
Behind it was the Truth.

00:30:30.987 --> 00:30:34.189
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:37.204
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:40.836
you become emotionally intelligent.

00:30:42.413 --> 00:30:45.956
You understand that, if you really love something,

00:30:46.122 --> 00:30:51.862
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

00:30:52.318 --> 00:30:54.674
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

00:30:54.849 --> 00:30:56.657
I know it’s too much to say,

00:30:56.801 --> 00:31:03.174
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:05.136
about the family life.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.832
In our ashrams or in our programs

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.281
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

00:31:14.577 --> 00:31:20.288
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

00:31:20.425 --> 00:31:22.993
when we are trying to talk about Sahaja Yoga?”

00:31:24.846 --> 00:31:29.094
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

00:31:29.634 --> 00:31:31.206
You can tell them.

00:31:31.596 --> 00:31:34.748
If you have that emotional intelligence,

00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:37.920
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

00:31:38.184 --> 00:31:40.708
Not necessary I should go everywhere

00:31:40.842 --> 00:31:43.627
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:47.066
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:50.413
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:54.588
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

00:31:54.906 --> 00:31:59.794
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

00:32:01.749 --> 00:32:03.894
How could I capture that?

00:32:04.396 --> 00:32:08.476
Just think of that. Nine thousand people so much limit of...

00:32:09.088 --> 00:32:12.124
Then also other countries I have seen.

00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:16.574
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:19.220
that captures the heart of the people.

00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:25.160
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

00:32:25.348 --> 00:32:28.362
people will abhor you. Alright.

00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:31.622
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:40.348
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

00:32:42.181 --> 00:32:45.483
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

00:32:46.118 --> 00:32:49.327
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

00:32:50.452 --> 00:32:57.152
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:59.503
because they have no emotional intelligence.

00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:06.505
All these people are devoid of that great quality

00:33:06.786 --> 00:33:08.755
of emotional intelligence.

00:33:09.837 --> 00:33:12.274
If your country is very progressive,

00:33:12.418 --> 00:33:16.003
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

00:33:16.858 --> 00:33:19.267
That way, they are philanthropists, I know.

00:33:19.753 --> 00:33:22.089
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

00:33:22.436 --> 00:33:26.185
But behind that is they want to have power.

00:33:29.185 --> 00:33:31.622
They want to rule people with that money.

00:33:32.956 --> 00:33:37.616
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

00:33:38.041 --> 00:33:41.394
If they start some sort of a charity,

00:33:41.913 --> 00:33:46.038
that is just to have a big name on the television,

00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:51.945
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

00:33:52.148 --> 00:33:55.270
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

00:33:56.618 --> 00:34:00.331
Wee part of it they will donate, wee part of their property

00:34:01.046 --> 00:34:04.276
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

00:34:04.557 --> 00:34:07.370
because they want to cash everything…

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:09.945
Cash has been given so cash they will...

00:34:10.912 --> 00:34:13.072
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.795
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

00:34:18.293 --> 00:34:22.411
You have to send love to all over the world.

00:34:23.023 --> 00:34:27.141
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

00:34:27.812 --> 00:34:31.800
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

00:34:32.268 --> 00:34:35.564
If you are attached, say to your country only—

00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:37.541
now this is a bigger issue —

00:34:37.762 --> 00:34:41.651
then you will try to exploit other countries,

00:34:41.948 --> 00:34:45.344
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

00:34:45.617 --> 00:34:48.386
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

00:34:48.611 --> 00:34:53.053
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:58.079
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

00:34:58.829 --> 00:35:01.966
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:07.267
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

00:35:10.777 --> 00:35:14.131
There is a very great chance for all of you

00:35:15.062 --> 00:35:17.895
to get this within your reach,

00:35:18.033 --> 00:35:20.226
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:20.593 --> 00:35:22.706
You have become like lotuses.

00:35:23.016 --> 00:35:26.825
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

00:35:27.796 --> 00:35:31.771
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:34.879
and it spreads the fragrance.

00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:38.313
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

00:35:38.578 --> 00:35:42.653
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

00:35:43.562 --> 00:35:46.410
beautiful house of the lotus

00:35:46.864 --> 00:35:50.723
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

00:35:51.054 --> 00:35:53.939
All kinds of things that come for the flower

00:35:58.334 --> 00:36:10.153
to take the little of that beauty 

00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:12.140
of that flower,

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:16.341
we can say, because you can extract also

00:36:16.482 --> 00:36:19.122
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:23.904
You can also get some honey out of that.

00:36:24.134 --> 00:36:28.029
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

00:36:28.928 --> 00:36:32.405
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

00:36:32.577 --> 00:36:36.688
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:43.706
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

00:36:44.659 --> 00:36:47.665
You are not made into some sort of creeps

00:36:47.824 --> 00:36:52.735
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

00:36:54.088 --> 00:36:59.418
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

00:36:59.678 --> 00:37:03.168
fragrance of your compassion to others.

00:37:03.363 --> 00:37:05.324
And you should feel happy about it.

00:37:06.096 --> 00:37:08.209
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

00:37:08.317 --> 00:37:10.106
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

00:37:10.524 --> 00:37:12.817
But it means that, whatever you have,

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.406
whatever is your possibility, capability,

00:37:15.579 --> 00:37:19.783
you must try to do for others, giving to them.

00:37:20.892 --> 00:37:23.646
And the more you do it, it's collectivity……

00:37:23.863 --> 00:37:27.772
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:31.169
because everybody is trying to follow America,

00:37:32.242 --> 00:37:35.322
money-making business, this business, that thing.

00:37:37.122 --> 00:37:38.960
But you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:39.169 --> 00:37:42.134
so what you have to do is take

00:37:43.367 --> 00:37:48.739
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

00:37:49.129 --> 00:37:53.218
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:55.699
don’t even bother about it.

00:37:56.535 --> 00:37:59.246
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:59.787 --> 00:38:01.748
They are not bothered about it.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.482
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:06.644
because what was the need for Me

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:10.656
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

00:38:10.843 --> 00:38:13.193
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:16.755
In the same way, you should also feel now

00:38:16.972 --> 00:38:19.721
that:  “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:22.013
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

00:38:22.158 --> 00:38:24.342
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

00:38:24.487 --> 00:38:26.542
Christ had only twelve disciples,

00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:29.060
and how much they spread Christianity!

00:38:30.047 --> 00:38:34.063
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

00:38:34.236 --> 00:38:36.313
you have so much of knowledge,

00:38:36.576 --> 00:38:40.821
absolute knowledge and experience.

00:38:41.463 --> 00:38:44.304
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.850
you can capture the people.

00:38:47.498 --> 00:38:50.975
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:56.802
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:57.479 --> 00:38:59.144
You want to be leader,

00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:01.035
or you want to put down somebody,

00:39:01.158 --> 00:39:03.977
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:07.460
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

00:39:07.568 --> 00:39:09.502
because they want to enhance themselves.

00:39:12.543 --> 00:39:16.995
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:21.375
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:22.218 --> 00:39:25.954
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.929
It’s very, very simple.

00:39:28.102 --> 00:39:30.349
Only thing, you should understand

00:39:30.472 --> 00:39:35.392
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

00:39:37.395 --> 00:39:39.458
You are not to rot.

00:39:40.157 --> 00:39:42.487
You are not to waste your life.

00:39:44.203 --> 00:39:46.373
We have started marriages,

00:39:46.626 --> 00:39:49.706
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

00:39:50.009 --> 00:39:53.139
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

00:39:53.383 --> 00:39:56.543
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

00:39:57.118 --> 00:39:59.627
What are they doing for others?

00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:02.267
What sort of children they are producing?

00:40:02.557 --> 00:40:04.373
You have to see to it

00:40:04.621 --> 00:40:09.083
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:09.501 --> 00:40:13.382
Your family should be a different type,

00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:17.038
your love for your family should be of a different type.

00:40:17.743 --> 00:40:21.018
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

00:40:21.504 --> 00:40:25.407
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

00:40:26.401 --> 00:40:28.558
I know some people grow very fast,

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.745
but some don’t, because they lack this

00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:35.403
balance between emotion and intelligence.

00:40:35.878 --> 00:40:39.765
This balance has to be completely established.

00:40:39.981 --> 00:40:44.799
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

00:40:45.065 --> 00:40:50.128
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:53.892
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

00:40:54.391 --> 00:40:57.953
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

00:40:58.198 --> 00:41:03.447
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:09.859
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

00:41:10.162 --> 00:41:13.377
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

00:41:13.489 --> 00:41:16.689
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

00:41:17.064 --> 00:41:20.785
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

00:41:21.433 --> 00:41:24.159
So, in our general attitude also,

00:41:25.313 --> 00:41:29.042
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

00:41:29.546 --> 00:41:32.106
Are we really doing what is to be done?

00:41:32.315 --> 00:41:34.710
What are we doing for morality?”

00:41:35.517 --> 00:41:38.712
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.859
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

00:41:43.141 --> 00:41:45.231
everything’s very important,

00:41:45.751 --> 00:41:49.205
and all other things that you have, you should try.

00:41:49.711 --> 00:41:55.523
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

00:41:55.948 --> 00:41:58.349
you should try to concentrate on them

00:41:58.522 --> 00:42:00.902
and see for yourself what are you doing?

00:42:02.532 --> 00:42:05.106
What are you making out of your life?

00:42:05.473 --> 00:42:08.453
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

00:42:08.742 --> 00:42:11.518
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.116
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

00:42:16.234 --> 00:42:18.845
what is your quality, what are you.

00:42:19.689 --> 00:42:23.071
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
