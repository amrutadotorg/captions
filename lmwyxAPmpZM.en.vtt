00:04.341 --> 00:12.338
Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

05:00.498 --> 05:05.690
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

05:08.021 --> 05:15.434
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti,  how

05:17.855 --> 05:23.606
She had to work out so many things in this world —

05:25.498 --> 05:31.033
first to create and then

05:33.454 --> 05:37.393
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

05:38.750 --> 05:42.936
After that, to comfort.

05:46.031 --> 05:51.826
Then to counsel.

05:53.164 --> 05:59.643
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

06:01.381 --> 06:05.245
They told what was wrong, what was right,

06:05.773 --> 06:09.313
what should we do, what we should not do,

06:09.920 --> 06:16.813
what is self-respect and what is the

06:19.884 --> 06:26.349
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

06:27.442 --> 06:29.346
So many of Them came on this Earth.

06:30.235 --> 06:34.047
One after another, in every country, They came

06:35.130 --> 06:40.268
and Their counselling formed religions.

06:40.912 --> 06:43.914
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

06:44.155 --> 06:47.067
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

06:47.739 --> 06:53.836
that They formed religions after religions,

06:56.491 --> 07:01.114
by which only human beings were divided,

07:03.835 --> 07:08.353
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

07:09.509 --> 07:13.889
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

07:14.721 --> 07:19.125
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

07:20.098 --> 07:23.155
While Those who came as counsellors

07:24.132 --> 07:27.325
talked about complete unity,

07:28.266 --> 07:31.147
complete oneness of human race,

07:31.459 --> 07:37.709
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

07:38.362 --> 07:41.975
did all kinds of wrong things

07:42.581 --> 07:47.432
and created a country or,

07:47.626 --> 07:53.996
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

07:54.362 --> 07:57.777
arising out of religion.

07:58.813 --> 08:05.372
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

08:07.099 --> 08:10.879
Religion is there to understand love,

08:11.271 --> 08:14.247
imbibe love and compassion.

08:17.187 --> 08:25.076
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

08:26.461 --> 08:29.955
that is the one Kundalini within us.

08:31.697 --> 08:39.049
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

08:40.191 --> 08:44.891
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

08:45.789 --> 08:48.172
Absolute it is!

08:49.088 --> 08:53.447
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

08:55.626 --> 09:00.567
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

09:01.158 --> 09:06.779
that everything has to be united.

09:08.576 --> 09:14.977
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.205
If that thing starts happening,

09:20.486 --> 09:24.433
all the problems of the world will be finished.

09:24.926 --> 09:27.714
So the first thing, redemption,

09:28.113 --> 09:31.462
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

09:32.275 --> 09:39.444
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

09:40.887 --> 09:45.579
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

09:47.115 --> 09:52.770
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

09:53.202 --> 09:56.997
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

09:57.362 --> 10:01.443
but actually the all religions are based only

10:01.654 --> 10:06.523
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

10:09.206 --> 10:12.194
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

10:12.504 --> 10:15.416
you start seeking, seeking

10:17.377 --> 10:21.585
earnest, the Truth.

10:24.379 --> 10:26.524
And the revelation of truth,

10:26.945 --> 10:32.114
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

10:32.274 --> 10:34.247
through your reformation

10:34.573 --> 10:41.203
that you become person who knows the Truth.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.908
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

10:46.980 --> 10:48.861
which is your Kundalini.

10:49.684 --> 10:52.977
And when this thing takes place,

10:54.173 --> 10:58.609
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

11:00.655 --> 11:06.357
You become a beautiful human being.

11:07.170 --> 11:13.164
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

11:13.891 --> 11:18.192
it looks like all other small

11:21.605 --> 11:25.907
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

11:26.134 --> 11:28.752
small dirty things that are in the pond.

11:31.163 --> 11:33.944
And then, once it starts coming out,

11:34.841 --> 11:41.895
coming out of that horrible water,

11:43.176 --> 11:46.352
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

11:47.062 --> 11:52.448
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

11:52.932 --> 11:59.090
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

12:00.243 --> 12:03.729
but flowers like a lotus.

12:04.939 --> 12:07.267
It doesn’t have all these insects,

12:07.649 --> 12:12.452
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

12:14.051 --> 12:17.602
It sucks only the pure water

12:18.191 --> 12:23.146
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.620
So what is left within you

12:27.065 --> 12:32.418
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

12:33.685 --> 12:36.510
just like a lotus.

12:38.125 --> 12:44.257
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

12:44.940 --> 12:49.579
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

12:50.218 --> 12:53.551
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

12:56.923 --> 13:00.521
And this state that you have achieved now,

13:01.293 --> 13:05.914
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

13:07.322 --> 13:09.672
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

13:10.287 --> 13:15.846
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

13:16.913 --> 13:21.168
One can say that it has made lots of money.

13:22.434 --> 13:28.263
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

13:29.952 --> 13:32.943
What you get is the satisfaction,

13:33.884 --> 13:41.729
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

13:43.775 --> 13:46.801
And the second thing that happens to you,

13:46.912 --> 13:49.515
you become absolutely collective.

13:50.352 --> 13:52.550
This has to happen.

13:53.523 --> 13:59.469
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

14:00.308 --> 14:05.873
For example, family is very, very weak here.

14:07.051 --> 14:14.771
Family that has been created by natural relationships

14:15.397 --> 14:19.206
is not so much respected as it should have.

14:20.353 --> 14:24.957
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

14:27.239 --> 14:31.285
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

14:34.126 --> 14:39.873
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

14:40.617 --> 14:44.692
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

14:45.866 --> 14:48.997
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

14:49.327 --> 14:52.985
some people who are working for money,

14:53.864 --> 14:59.172
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

14:59.814 --> 15:01.948
who are not so well off.

15:02.187 --> 15:06.030
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

15:06.369 --> 15:10.206
looking after the children, building up the families

15:10.364 --> 15:16.887
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

15:17.580 --> 15:20.523
some organization.

15:22.114 --> 15:26.217
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

15:27.140 --> 15:30.414
Why should they think they are something higher

15:30.594 --> 15:33.140
than the women who are working hard

15:33.284 --> 15:37.936
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

15:38.462 --> 15:43.280
bearing all the brunt of the society.

15:44.852 --> 15:50.542
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

15:50.837 --> 15:54.703
in America and also Western countries.

15:55.683 --> 15:58.243
When money becomes important,

15:58.936 --> 16:01.351
if when money is important,

16:01.647 --> 16:07.676
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

16:08.389 --> 16:09.708
Very surprising.

16:09.817 --> 16:13.489
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

16:14.037 --> 16:15.917
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

16:16.033 --> 16:19.345
who is a householder, is not respected.

16:20.556 --> 16:23.051
And with this, I tell you,

16:23.685 --> 16:28.049
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

16:29.016 --> 16:32.793
You can work, you can be educated,

16:33.153 --> 16:37.048
but you should be able to look after your family

16:37.424 --> 16:42.674
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

16:44.021 --> 16:47.405
Instead of that, educated women,

16:47.628 --> 16:50.628
I call them manly women,

16:50.931 --> 16:55.583
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

16:56.729 --> 17:00.068
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

17:01.122 --> 17:04.142
So this kind of a disparity that exists

17:04.713 --> 17:08.109
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

17:08.289 --> 17:10.257
We are educated”

17:10.676 --> 17:13.725
are really manly women, I must say.

17:14.563 --> 17:18.840
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

17:19.935 --> 17:23.866
look after the children, look after the family,

17:24.183 --> 17:28.763
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.729
So, such women must be respected

17:33.334 --> 17:36.637
by their husbands, by the men,

17:36.962 --> 17:39.269
members  of the family — not only that,

17:39.536 --> 17:42.680
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

17:42.854 --> 17:46.236
who are doing such a difficult task.

17:47.101 --> 17:50.383
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

17:51.408 --> 17:54.904
to run the house, to look after the children,

17:55.201 --> 17:59.310
to look after the complete organization

17:59.758 --> 18:03.631
and looking after the expenditure

18:04.532 --> 18:06.963
of the money, if that is limited.

18:08.368 --> 18:11.744
This ego has to go.

18:13.041 --> 18:17.188
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

18:17.404 --> 18:23.131
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

18:24.753 --> 18:28.828
World of men —I was really laughing.

18:29.196 --> 18:33.429
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

18:33.689 --> 18:36.349
Can they exist without women?”

18:36.861 --> 18:41.643
But I was amazed at her question because she said

18:41.784 --> 18:46.691
that: “Even in the jail, criminals are so much respectful,

18:47.174 --> 18:48.861
how is it possible?

18:49.056 --> 18:52.893
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

18:53.686 --> 18:57.450
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

18:57.630 --> 19:01.438
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

19:03.731 --> 19:06.688
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

19:07.164 --> 19:12.140
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.414
That’s the point one should know,

19:15.689 --> 19:19.807
that woman is a much more important thing

19:20.101 --> 19:24.559
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

19:26.044 --> 19:29.852
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

19:29.973 --> 19:33.574
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

19:34.281 --> 19:36.155
and create problems.

19:37.696 --> 19:40.784
And mother’s job is not to control.

19:41.533 --> 19:44.960
Her job is to love, to give compassion

19:45.184 --> 19:48.645
and this is the quality of women is lost

19:48.861 --> 19:51.804
in these Western, so-called advanced,

19:53.225 --> 19:56.571
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

19:56.881 --> 20:01.547
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

20:01.807 --> 20:07.122
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

20:07.748 --> 20:12.003
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

20:12.458 --> 20:15.797
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

20:17.383 --> 20:21.032
Today, I think it is important to say

20:21.473 --> 20:25.929
that all of you should understand the value of women

20:26.231 --> 20:28.199
who are housewives.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.014
It’s a tremendous job

20:32.116 --> 20:35.391
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

20:37.691 --> 20:40.835
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

20:41.967 --> 20:46.662
She will also look after the children.

20:48.011 --> 20:50.318
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

20:50.701 --> 20:54.271
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

20:55.366 --> 20:58.785
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

20:59.276 --> 21:01.958
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

21:02.744 --> 21:06.285
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

21:06.371 --> 21:09.704
you must understand their responsibility.

21:11.052 --> 21:15.502
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

21:15.809 --> 21:18.997
all the Western societies are collapsing,

21:19.127 --> 21:22.812
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

21:26.914 --> 21:29.799
So, the women should not feel in any way less

21:29.994 --> 21:32.807
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

21:33.002 --> 21:35.539
They should not feel inferior to anybody

21:35.655 --> 21:39.030
who thinks that they are something great.

21:40.754 --> 21:44.266
Basically, the families have to be good.

21:45.059 --> 21:48.398
This collectivity must work first in the family.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.824
The children are to be groomed properly.

21:52.257 --> 21:54.780
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.047
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.439
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

22:03.565 --> 22:08.194
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

22:09.322 --> 22:11.840
They are not given any attention.

22:12.438 --> 22:17.205
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

22:17.566 --> 22:20.998
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

22:21.172 --> 22:24.575
because there’s so much, so much neglect

22:24.792 --> 22:27.864
and so much of hatred for children.

22:29.555 --> 22:34.019
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

22:34.150 --> 22:38.288
you must look after your children.

22:40.610 --> 22:44.736
Not only that, with love and compassion,

22:45.954 --> 22:52.285
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

22:52.718 --> 22:57.140
but a person who is a source,

22:57.493 --> 23:01.070
who is a source of joy and compassion.

23:02.634 --> 23:06.471
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

23:06.615 --> 23:10.041
the emotional intelligence.

23:13.069 --> 23:15.752
That is what we should try to imbibe.

23:16.467 --> 23:20.144
Emotional intelligence, that means

23:20.310 --> 23:24.435
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

23:26.771 --> 23:30.168
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

23:30.305 --> 23:32.361
our society cannot work.

23:33.550 --> 23:37.582
In an emotional intelligence, you care

23:38.351 --> 23:40.678
and you enjoy caring.

23:41.602 --> 23:46.413
You do everything for others

23:47.229 --> 23:50.711
with a great emotional understanding.

23:50.885 --> 23:53.854
Not for one child, not for one son,

23:54.050 --> 23:59.668
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

24:01.131 --> 24:04.781
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

24:05.271 --> 24:08.567
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

24:10.243 --> 24:15.400
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

24:16.042 --> 24:20.772
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

24:21.040 --> 24:23.462
to give anything to others.

24:24.076 --> 24:28.799
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

24:29.514 --> 24:34.323
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

24:34.648 --> 24:38.585
Why should he? Everything for selfishness.

24:39.659 --> 24:43.042
Then such people indulge into corruption,

24:43.482 --> 24:46.128
indulge into all kinds of things,

24:46.323 --> 24:50.340
which are only selfish in attitude.

24:51.832 --> 24:54.487
Now we are talking of collectivity.

24:55.186 --> 24:58.474
In collectivity, we do for others.

24:59.578 --> 25:01.820
We enjoy doing for others.

25:02.607 --> 25:06.601
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

25:06.796 --> 25:10.323
because your children will also become the same kind

25:10.518 --> 25:13.006
and they will only bother about themselves.

25:15.682 --> 25:20.282
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

25:20.867 --> 25:25.517
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

25:26.326 --> 25:32.484
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

25:33.378 --> 25:34.978
Both things are wrong.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.751
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

25:39.754 --> 25:44.960
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

25:45.710 --> 25:49.560
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

25:50.174 --> 25:52.295
from the collectivity.

25:53.173 --> 25:57.292
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

25:58.828 --> 26:02.816
attached to one child, attached to one person,

26:03.176 --> 26:06.263
to someone, even in the society.

26:07.049 --> 26:11.023
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

26:12.999 --> 26:16.013
Why you bothered about one person only?

26:16.640 --> 26:20.239
All such people fall into such terrible play.

26:20.657 --> 26:22.841
In the politics you have seen how,

26:22.986 --> 26:25.142
people try to help their own sons

26:25.243 --> 26:27.696
and own daughters and this and that.

26:27.797 --> 26:30.386
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

26:30.695 --> 26:33.458
kind of an emotional attachment.

26:38.548 --> 26:43.466
So, according to ethics,

26:44.504 --> 26:49.561
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

26:51.629 --> 26:54.854
by which you give to others,

26:55.960 --> 27:00.071
you care for others, for everyone

27:01.304 --> 27:04.398
and you become very, very collective.

27:08.047 --> 27:11.926
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

27:12.100 --> 27:14.697
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

27:15.439 --> 27:18.284
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

27:18.393 --> 27:20.711
You want to be exclusive.

27:21.688 --> 27:29.296
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.040
That is the best thing that you can have.

27:33.414 --> 27:37.597
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

27:38.839 --> 27:44.579
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

27:44.997 --> 27:51.358
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

27:53.073 --> 27:55.265
I understand about everyone.

27:55.922 --> 28:01.122
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

28:01.476 --> 28:06.905
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

28:07.460 --> 28:11.614
Whatever you say, I can understand,

28:11.780 --> 28:13.495
because I am at a level

28:13.633 --> 28:17.536
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

28:18.516 --> 28:23.766
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

28:24.616 --> 28:28.994
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

28:31.222 --> 28:35.873
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

28:36.660 --> 28:40.898
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

28:42.001 --> 28:47.748
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

28:47.885 --> 28:53.166
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

28:55.747 --> 28:59.418
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

29:00.161 --> 29:03.326
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

29:03.535 --> 29:05.872
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

29:06.766 --> 29:09.687
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

29:10.430 --> 29:13.292
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

29:15.845 --> 29:21.139
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

29:22.422 --> 29:27.485
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

29:28.956 --> 29:34.344
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

29:35.129 --> 29:38.540
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

29:38.742 --> 29:42.319
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

29:42.738 --> 29:47.324
and even the family gets broken,

29:48.175 --> 29:51.203
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

29:52.253 --> 29:54.445
I have known so many women

29:54.929 --> 29:57.374
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

29:57.475 --> 29:59.098
I don’t know how they can do it.

29:59.335 --> 30:03.490
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

30:05.075 --> 30:09.677
It is something that is a sense of giving.

30:10.860 --> 30:14.545
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

30:14.791 --> 30:16.420
That’s also another idea,

30:16.557 --> 30:19.593
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

30:20.956 --> 30:23.840
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.020
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

30:27.901 --> 30:30.172
Behind Him was the Truth.

30:30.987 --> 30:34.189
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

30:34.301 --> 30:37.204
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

30:37.536 --> 30:40.836
you become emotionally intelligent.

30:42.413 --> 30:45.956
You understand that, if you really love something,

30:46.122 --> 30:51.862
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.674
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

30:54.849 --> 30:56.657
I know it’s too much to say,

30:56.801 --> 31:03.174
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

31:03.333 --> 31:05.136
about the family life.

31:05.700 --> 31:09.832
In our ashrams or in our programs

31:10.020 --> 31:14.281
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

31:14.577 --> 31:20.288
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

31:20.425 --> 31:22.993
when we are trying to talk among Sahaja Yoga?”

31:24.846 --> 31:29.094
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

31:29.634 --> 31:31.206
You can tell them.

31:31.596 --> 31:34.748
If you have that emotional intelligence,

31:35.094 --> 31:37.920
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

31:38.184 --> 31:40.708
Not necessary I should go everywhere

31:40.842 --> 31:43.627
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

31:44.521 --> 31:47.066
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

31:47.297 --> 31:50.413
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

31:50.629 --> 31:54.588
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

31:54.906 --> 31:59.794
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

32:01.749 --> 32:03.894
How could I capture that?

32:04.396 --> 32:08.476
Just think of that. Nine thousand people come to you!

32:09.088 --> 32:12.124
Then also other countries I have seen.

32:12.722 --> 32:16.574
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

32:16.703 --> 32:19.220
that captures the heart of the people.

32:20.526 --> 32:25.160
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

32:25.348 --> 32:28.362
people will abhor you. Alright.

32:29.019 --> 32:31.622
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

32:31.967 --> 32:40.348
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

32:42.181 --> 32:45.483
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

32:46.118 --> 32:49.327
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

32:50.452 --> 32:57.152
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

32:57.246 --> 32:59.503
because they have no emotional intelligence.

33:01.701 --> 33:06.505
All these people are devoid of that great quality

33:06.786 --> 33:08.755
of emotional intelligence.

33:09.837 --> 33:12.274
If your country is very progressive,

33:12.418 --> 33:16.003
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

33:16.858 --> 33:19.267
That way, they have philanthropists, I know.

33:19.753 --> 33:22.089
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

33:22.436 --> 33:26.185
But behind that is they want to have power.

33:29.185 --> 33:31.622
They want to rule people with that money.

33:32.956 --> 33:37.616
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

33:38.041 --> 33:41.394
If they start some sort of a charity,

33:41.913 --> 33:46.038
that is just to have a big name on the television,

33:46.276 --> 33:51.945
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

33:52.148 --> 33:55.270
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

33:56.618 --> 34:00.331
We part of their  [UNCLEAR]   we part of their property

34:01.046 --> 34:04.276
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

34:04.557 --> 34:07.370
because they want to cash everything…

34:07.579 --> 34:09.945
Cash has been lots of cashed  in

34:10.912 --> 34:13.072
You are Sahaja Yogis.

34:14.290 --> 34:17.795
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

34:18.293 --> 34:22.411
You have to send love to all over the world.

34:23.023 --> 34:27.141
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

34:27.812 --> 34:31.800
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

34:32.268 --> 34:35.564
If you are attached, say to your country only—

34:35.861 --> 34:37.541
now this is a bigger issue —

34:37.762 --> 34:41.651
then you will try to exploit other countries,

34:41.948 --> 34:45.344
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.386
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

34:48.611 --> 34:53.053
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

34:54.379 --> 34:58.079
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

34:58.829 --> 35:01.966
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

35:02.210 --> 35:07.267
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

35:10.777 --> 35:14.131
There is a very great chance for all of you

35:15.062 --> 35:17.895
to get this within your reach,

35:18.033 --> 35:20.226
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

35:20.593 --> 35:22.706
You have become like lotuses.

35:23.016 --> 35:26.825
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

35:27.796 --> 35:31.771
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

35:32.059 --> 35:34.879
and it spreads the fragrance.

35:35.175 --> 35:38.313
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

35:38.578 --> 35:42.653
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

35:43.562 --> 35:46.410
beautiful house of the lotus

35:46.864 --> 35:50.723
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

35:51.054 --> 35:53.939
All kinds of things that come from the flower

35:58.334 --> 36:10.153
to take the beauty

36:10.709 --> 36:12.140
of that flower,

36:12.467 --> 36:16.341
we can say, because you can extract also

36:16.482 --> 36:19.122
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

36:19.756 --> 36:23.904
You can also get some honey out of that.

36:24.134 --> 36:28.029
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

36:28.928 --> 36:32.405
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

36:32.577 --> 36:36.688
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

36:39.869 --> 36:43.706
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

36:44.659 --> 36:47.665
You are not made into some sort of creeps

36:47.824 --> 36:52.735
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

36:54.088 --> 36:59.418
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

36:59.678 --> 37:03.168
fragrance of your compassion to others.

37:03.363 --> 37:05.324
And you should feel happy about it.

37:06.096 --> 37:08.209
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

37:08.317 --> 37:10.106
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

37:10.524 --> 37:12.817
But it means that, whatever you have,

37:12.990 --> 37:15.406
whatever is your possibility, capability,

37:15.579 --> 37:19.783
you must try to do for others, give it to them.

37:20.892 --> 37:23.646
And the more you do in this collectivity…

37:23.863 --> 37:27.772
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

37:27.981 --> 37:31.169
because everybody is trying to follow America,

37:32.242 --> 37:35.322
money-making business, this business, that thing.

37:37.122 --> 37:38.960
But you are all Sahaja Yogis,

37:39.169 --> 37:42.134
so what you have to do is take

37:43.367 --> 37:48.739
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

37:49.129 --> 37:53.218
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

37:53.491 --> 37:55.699
don’t even bother about it.

37:56.535 --> 37:59.246
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

37:59.787 --> 38:01.748
They are not bothered about it.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.482
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

38:04.719 --> 38:06.644
because what was the need for Me

38:06.767 --> 38:10.656
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

38:10.843 --> 38:13.193
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

38:14.167 --> 38:16.755
In the same way, you should also feel now

38:16.972 --> 38:19.721
that:  “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

38:19.981 --> 38:22.013
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

38:22.158 --> 38:24.342
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

38:24.487 --> 38:26.542
Christ had only twelve disciples,

38:26.686 --> 38:29.060
and how much they spread Christianity!

38:30.047 --> 38:34.063
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

38:34.236 --> 38:36.313
you have so much of knowledge,

38:36.576 --> 38:40.821
absolute knowledge and experience.

38:41.463 --> 38:44.304
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

38:44.650 --> 38:46.850
you can capture the people.

38:47.498 --> 38:50.975
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

38:52.691 --> 38:56.802
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

38:57.479 --> 38:59.144
You want to be leader,

38:59.231 --> 39:01.035
or you want to put down somebody,

39:01.158 --> 39:03.977
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.460
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

39:07.568 --> 39:09.502
because they want to enhance themselves.

39:12.543 --> 39:16.995
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

39:17.669 --> 39:21.375
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

39:22.218 --> 39:25.954
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

39:26.330 --> 39:27.929
It’s very, very simple.

39:28.102 --> 39:30.349
Only thing, you should understand

39:30.472 --> 39:35.392
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

39:37.395 --> 39:39.458
You are not to rot.

39:40.157 --> 39:42.487
You are not to waste your life.

39:44.203 --> 39:46.373
We have started marriages,

39:46.626 --> 39:49.706
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

39:50.009 --> 39:53.139
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

39:53.383 --> 39:56.543
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

39:57.118 --> 39:59.627
What are they doing for others?

39:59.881 --> 40:02.267
What sort of children they are producing?

40:02.557 --> 40:04.373
You have to see to it

40:04.621 --> 40:09.083
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

40:09.501 --> 40:13.382
Your family should be a different type,

40:14.001 --> 40:17.038
your love for your family should be of a different type.

40:17.743 --> 40:21.018
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

40:21.504 --> 40:25.407
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

40:26.401 --> 40:28.558
I know some people grow very fast,

40:28.680 --> 40:31.745
but some don’t, because they lack this

40:32.055 --> 40:35.403
balance between emotion and intelligence.

40:35.878 --> 40:39.765
This balance has to be completely established.

40:39.981 --> 40:44.799
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

40:45.065 --> 40:50.128
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.892
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

40:54.391 --> 40:57.953
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

40:58.198 --> 41:03.447
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

41:05.764 --> 41:09.859
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

41:10.162 --> 41:13.377
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

41:13.489 --> 41:16.689
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

41:17.064 --> 41:20.785
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

41:21.433 --> 41:24.159
So, in our general attitude also,

41:25.313 --> 41:29.042
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

41:29.546 --> 41:32.106
Are we really doing what is to be done?

41:32.315 --> 41:34.710
What are we doing for morality?”

41:35.517 --> 41:38.712
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

41:39.420 --> 41:42.859
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

41:43.141 --> 41:45.231
everything’s very important,

41:45.751 --> 41:49.205
and all other things that you have, you should try.

41:49.711 --> 41:55.523
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

41:55.948 --> 41:58.349
you should try to concentrate on them

41:58.522 --> 42:00.902
and see for yourself what are you doing?

42:02.532 --> 42:05.106
What are you making out of your life?

42:05.473 --> 42:08.453
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

42:08.742 --> 42:11.518
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

42:11.640 --> 42:15.116
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

42:16.234 --> 42:18.845
what is your quality, what are you.

42:19.689 --> 42:23.071
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
