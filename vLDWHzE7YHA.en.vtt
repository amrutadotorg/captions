Shri Krishna Puja, You Have To Be Festive
Nirmal Temple, Cabella Ligure (Italy)

00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:51.099
Today we are going to worship Radha and Krishna.

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:59.196
It's a very festive feeling

00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:05.380
because Shri Krishna came on this earth

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:13.065
at a time when people had become

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:24.303
had become extremely serious about religion, about spirituality, and

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:36.478
that  made the whole aspect of religion as a joyless achievement.

00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:46.387
And that's how people became very serious;

00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:54.046
also the attention of people was diverted

00:06:54.507 --> 00:07:02.570
into a kind of a drama, which created aloofness from the society.

00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:13.685
People became individualistic, secretive

00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:19.773
and all such people's children also became the same style

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:31.152
because a kind of a fear, perhaps,

00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:40.969
developed among the people who were in pursuit of religion and truth.

00:07:50.563 --> 00:07:58.043
Now the family does make a difference

00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:04.567
and has a big influence on the personality of the people.

00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:11.438
So they got it from their parents

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.119
and then their grandchildren also got the same type of a feeling.

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:23.592
So, for 2,000 years after Shri Rama went away,

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:34.921
the whole situation became a very separate pursuit,

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:41.607
and they would not tell each other what they have found.

00:08:42.116 --> 00:08:46.976
They did not tell even their parents

00:08:47.252 --> 00:08:49.521
what they are seeking - what they wanted.

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:53.248
In this secretiveness they got lost

00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:57.994
and that's how there were lots of false gurus

00:08:58.074 --> 00:09:04.017
and false type of paths, were discovered.

00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:09.453
Still it was not so bad, but this aloofness

00:09:09.898 --> 00:09:13.802
made the society look so disintegrated.

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:21.314
The collectivity was thus - even in the family it was not there.

00:09:21.607 --> 00:09:25.858
The father wouldn't talk to the son, he wouldn't talk to his wife or

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:29.688
maybe the wife may not talk to her children.

00:09:30.077 --> 00:09:34.144
They religiously followed - in India especially

00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:36.884
- followed the dharma part.

00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:41.110
But they went to the right side - I would say.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.761
In such an austere manner they followed

00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:52.040
Gita without seeing through the lines what was written there.

00:09:52.552 --> 00:09:57.818
As I've told you many a times - that when he talked of Karma Yoga -

00:09:58.001 --> 00:10:03.736
he said that action should become non-action -  Akarma.

00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:10.940
How, he said, put everything at the Lotus Feet of Shri Krishna,

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.946
But that never happened.

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:17.319
You see because, unless and until you get your self-realization,

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.070
you always think you're doing something, like that,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.445
you're achieving something and when you start doing

00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:35.183
then you also start sometimes overpowering others, dominating others.

00:10:36.008 --> 00:10:41.588
And there is another group that starts thinking that,

00:10:41.787 --> 00:10:48.067
I'm being aggressed, I'm so much in pain, in trouble.

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:52.933
So there, two types of people developed - one aggressive type

00:10:53.037 --> 00:11:00.517
and another were the people who were absolutely crying and weeping.

00:11:01.382 --> 00:11:05.621
In those days, of course after Krishna -

00:11:05.757 --> 00:11:09.090
before Krishna came - all these things were such.

00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:16.188
So, Krishna started talking about

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:22.095
the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:26.443
He said that a Sahaja Yogi is a balanced person.

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:31.067
For him, happiness and unhappiness has no meaning -

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:36.431
whatever he does he feels it's all done by God Almighty -

00:11:36.548 --> 00:11:39.333
but you have to be a Sahaja Yogi to be that way.

00:11:39.483 --> 00:11:43.766
Though he described a Sahaja Yogi, there were no Sahaja Yogis at that time.

00:11:43.925 --> 00:11:46.274
Mostly people were extremely austere,

00:11:46.383 --> 00:11:50.445
they went to Himalayas and all the places for seeking truth -

00:11:50.531 --> 00:11:54.372
what Gita had told, they followed it.

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:58.184
So, another thing started was a bhakti cult.

00:11:58.272 --> 00:12:05.062
In the bhakti cult, I mean when they moved in a collective,

00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:10.250
see they thought we should have a bhakti of Shri Rama.

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:14.433
And in that bhakti also, they were secretive,

00:12:14.624 --> 00:12:18.627
they wouldn't tell anybody what they were doing and what was it.

00:12:18.785 --> 00:12:22.624
But, Shri Krishna came and he talked about bhakti,

00:12:22.727 --> 00:12:27.079
that - he said that - you have to have bhakti

00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:33.119
when it is absolutely surrendered to God.

00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:37.847
Ananya, means that "you are not the other"

00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:43.431
- you become one - and this is what people missed,

00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:47.491
because they thought Ananya means

00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:52.891
complete, full, from the heart - it was not so.

00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:58.653
So, Shri Krishna was also misunderstood by these people

00:12:58.772 --> 00:13:03.642
and they went to another extreme with this Ananya Bhakti.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.928
You know now a big wave started in Bengal only

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.206
and people used to run on the street -

00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:16.799
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, and used to do all kinds of things all over

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.113
without understanding what he said about bhakti -

00:13:21.193 --> 00:13:24.034
how to have bhakti without connection -

00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:27.372
there is no bhakti according to him.

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:31.784
So, some people got lost into that kind of a bhakti,

00:13:31.904 --> 00:13:40.095
which was not at all meant for your ascent,  for your evolution.

00:13:40.595 --> 00:13:45.172
But with that, you see also, so many saints who came;

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:49.621
they didn't know what to tell people about because they couldn't give them realization.

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:51.625
So, they said you should remember God.

00:13:51.713 --> 00:13:55.927
You should remember the name of Shri Ram, Shri Krishna and all that.

00:13:56.151 --> 00:13:59.527
Especially in Maharashtra there were many saints who said that -

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:02.301
they try to remember the name of God.

00:14:02.373 --> 00:14:07.550
But it didn't mean, just remember means, just all the time to say - Oh,

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:11.491
do whatever you like and say "I remember God."

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:15.241
So, you see, they also have failed that way - I should say.

00:14:15.383 --> 00:14:21.200
Because they never understood what sort of human beings they were facing.

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.073
Also, the saints became very

00:14:27.147 --> 00:14:31.639
intimidated by other priests and other people.

00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:35.525
So, in that, we have two types of saints

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.841
where we have people who are talking of

00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:44.882
"Birahar" means,  separation from God.

00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:48.842
Even, Ravindranath was like that to begin with.

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:55.275
And then they start talking about the meeting of God.

00:14:55.545 --> 00:15:01.000
So, another type of saints were the real saints who talked about it,

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:08.208
but very few people really showed any interest in becoming that.

00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:12.131
They would say, we have regard for this, we respect this,

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:15.667
we believe in this, we believe in Shri Krishna.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:19.777
They used to go to a place called Pandapur in Maharashtra.

00:15:19.888 --> 00:15:25.756
Everywhere you go you will find Shri Krishna's thing all over the country.

00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:29.904
Especially in Gujarat, because Shri Krishna ruled there,

00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:34.308
so they are all believers of Shri Krishna.

00:15:37.176 --> 00:15:40.249
What he came for was forgotten.

00:15:40.593 --> 00:15:46.487
He was talking about realization, he was talking about connection.

00:15:46.726 --> 00:15:53.508
So in all these preachings they could not read between the lines

00:15:53.754 --> 00:15:56.941
and they started doing on their own.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:04.290
In our history, we have horrible things done in the name of Shri Krishna.

00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:09.758
Not only Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, but have a temple of Shri Nath -

00:16:09.973 --> 00:16:17.352
and that temple was created for a deity which  was very vibrated,

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:21.388
was the deity of Shri Krishna,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.512
when he ran away from the field of battle - Ranchordas.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:30.391
Now, when he ran away from the field of battle it was because

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:36.063
he wanted to deceive one monster and to get him killed.

00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:40.581
So, this Ranchordas state was very important  because

00:16:40.661 --> 00:16:44.912
how he tricked this horrible monster and how he managed

00:16:45.032 --> 00:16:49.811
to take him to a cave where a saint was

00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:55.405
sleeping and who was given a sort of a boon -

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:58.309
that anybody who tries to wake you up,

00:16:58.429 --> 00:17:01.214
you can open your third eye and kill him.

00:17:01.376 --> 00:17:03.638
So, Shri Krishna played a trick,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.455
he ran into his cave and this monster also ran after him,

00:17:08.582 --> 00:17:11.542
running away from the battle field,

00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:18.653
and he put his shawl on top of this

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.219
saint who was sleeping -

00:17:21.452 --> 00:17:25.002
so the monster came behind him,

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:29.499
he said "so now, you are tired from running and sleeping here

00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:31.066
and he pulled the shawl,

00:17:31.177 --> 00:17:39.048
and as soon as he pulled the shawl this saint got up and he burnt him.

00:17:39.189 --> 00:17:44.562
And that's how he killed this rakshasha, the devil.

00:17:51.456 --> 00:17:57.996
So, the life style of Shri Krishna was very different from that of Rama.

00:17:58.502 --> 00:18:04.877
Rama was the one who accepted everything,
he went into exile

00:18:05.068 --> 00:18:09.732
and he also spent 14 years,

00:18:09.868 --> 00:18:13.632
then he went out in search of his wife

00:18:13.735 --> 00:18:21.734
and also his children did not accept him much.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:29.824
Now, the aspect of Shri Krishna's life was very different.

00:18:30.034 --> 00:18:33.398
First thing, he came to know about human beings

00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:36.286
that they are very cunning people

00:18:36.477 --> 00:18:39.326
and if you tell them about God or anything,

00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:41.329
they will never accept.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.690
They will do the way they think about it.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:48.034
So he said, let us try the other way round.

00:18:48.197 --> 00:18:50.954
So, he played a trick with his preaching -

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:54.454
that you have to do your Karmas

00:18:54.626 --> 00:18:58.983
or your actions - which become non-actions -
which is an impossible situation -

00:18:59.047 --> 00:19:05.227
and the second one that your devotion should be

00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:08.334
Ananya - when you are connected.

00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:12.183
Now, these two conditions, nobody could fulfill, he knew.

00:19:12.248 --> 00:19:16.867
So, they will go on working on this and at the time of Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:17.018 --> 00:19:20.382
they'll come around knowing that  they have not achieved anything

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:25.731
by practicing all those things, whatever Shri Krishna has said.

00:19:26.175 --> 00:19:29.443
But his life style was different.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:35.284
When he came as a little boy,

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:39.270
he first tried to kill all the monsters

00:19:39.336 --> 00:19:45.148
who were invading Gokul, the place where he was living.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:49.440
In a different, different manner he killed

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.732
Putana, who was a horrible woman,

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:57.017
she was a rakshashi, whom he killed just

00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:59.086
by sucking her breast because

00:19:59.148 --> 00:20:03.980
she wanted to poison him with her poison

00:20:04.116 --> 00:20:05.888
and that's how he did it.

00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:09.216
So this shows you see, that the first thing

00:20:09.244 --> 00:20:12.608
he took to was extreme aggressiveness

00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:15.904
against all the negative forces that were working,

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:17.837
which Rama did not do.

00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:21.829
Rama succumbed to everything,
whatever was happening to begin with,

00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.295
later on then he killed Ravanna.

00:20:24.343 --> 00:20:27.583
But as a child, he was a sweet little child,

00:20:27.587 --> 00:20:30.403
and lots of descriptions are there about him.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.013
So, from very childhood, the attitude of Shri Krishna

00:20:34.077 --> 00:20:38.997
was more action as far as the negativity was concerned

00:20:39.096 --> 00:20:42.857
and he killed many rakshashas until he killed Kamsa.

00:20:42.988 --> 00:20:45.924
So, the first part was killing these people.

00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:48.136
Because they were very aggressive

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.130
and they were sucking the energy of the people

00:20:51.304 --> 00:20:57.644
and they were also becoming like a megalomaniac, as you call that,

00:20:57.787 --> 00:20:59.752
they used to think no end of themselves,

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:02.562
so there, you see, he killed their ego,

00:21:02.664 --> 00:21:04.643
he killed them, so many of them,

00:21:04.694 --> 00:21:10.991
and then he helped the Pandavas to establish the truth.

00:21:11.198 --> 00:21:14.946
To help the people who are truthful, who are for truth,

00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:17.953
but he could not give them realization,

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:19.877
he didn't give them realization.

00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:25.368
Up to a point he brought them to understand that always the truth wins.

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:29.378
They call it "Satyamewajyati" - the truth wins.

00:21:29.648 --> 00:21:33.985
This happened at the time when it was

00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:40.880
very important to show that those negative forces cannot overpower.

00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:43.244
To show how useless they were,

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:46.849
to show how they had been active

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:50.384
and have been dominating and everybody had fear

00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:53.375
but all of them were neutralized by him.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.327
That he can kill all these negative forces.

00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:03.408
This is one of his styles which is very important for modern times.

00:22:03.575 --> 00:22:08.482
Now, in America, as you see,
there are so many negative forces that have come up.

00:22:08.656 --> 00:22:11.916
They are in a different form, they are not like monsters.

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:17.160
But they are by temperament, are monsters.

00:22:18.002 --> 00:22:23.039
The collectivity that he preached through Rasadena and all that,

00:22:23.163 --> 00:22:27.666
that he brought in his, I should say adolescent

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:31.962
age, was also remarkable. That he made people dance together,

00:22:32.031 --> 00:22:37.753
pray together, to be festive and to know that you are a witness,

00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:43.442
you are not a slave of religion or of your meditation,

00:22:43.527 --> 00:22:45.654
but you have to be festive.

00:22:45.742 --> 00:22:50.720
And he got this introduction of Holi festivals

00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:53.486
and many others, like Rakhibandhan,

00:22:53.542 --> 00:22:57.422
all these he brought in because he thought this is how

00:22:57.485 --> 00:23:03.305
the society will be cleansed and
also they will have a lot of enjoyment.

00:23:03.401 --> 00:23:07.374
So the idea of enjoyment he brought it into the lives of people.

00:23:07.462 --> 00:23:12.838
In the little childish pranks he used to play on people

00:23:12.973 --> 00:23:19.107
just to teach them and make them turn to something

00:23:19.183 --> 00:23:21.594
that was a very great enjoyment.

00:23:21.788 --> 00:23:25.710
Now, his enjoyment was enjoyment of the spirit,

00:23:25.774 --> 00:23:29.234
the enjoyment, pure enjoyment.

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:32.861
You see all these things reflected in the American life today -

00:23:32.957 --> 00:23:35.091
but in a perverted way.

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:38.255
Now, the sense of enjoyment in American life

00:23:38.335 --> 00:23:42.424
is absolutely perverted, because it is self-destructive.

00:23:42.869 --> 00:23:45.860
Whatever they take to is self-destructive.

00:23:46.011 --> 00:23:48.511
You tell them anything they`ll say "what's wrong".

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.643
Why all these gurus prospered there because

00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:57.218
they pampered the ego of Americans and said "it's alright,

00:23:57.322 --> 00:24:01.445
you can do whatever you like, as long as you give us money".

00:24:01.681 --> 00:24:03.372
And this suited them very well

00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:05.816
and they started doing all these things

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.289
of a sort of - in a way going into perversion.

00:24:11.376 --> 00:24:13.099
Like Rajaneesh now.

00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:16.708
Rajaneesh came to America and how people liked him.

00:24:16.924 --> 00:24:19.530
He had a Rajaneesh “Hindi word” this, that

00:24:19.594 --> 00:24:24.380
and he established there thousands and thousands of people.

00:24:24.566 --> 00:24:28.006
But then again Shri Krishna's power worked on him

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:30.122
and he was defeated then.

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:34.306
Everywhere you find there are so many gurus like that.

00:24:34.458 --> 00:24:38.103
They all were defeated, really, by Shri Krishna's power,

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.807
because he has all the tricks of the trade.

00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:44.047
He knows how to make a fool out of them.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.949
Just imagine, this Rajaneesh was so powerful

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:49.504
and an idea came into his head that he can

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.787
become the lord of that place - or whatever it is, and they conspired,

00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:56.521
but its over - it's finished.

00:24:56.593 --> 00:25:00.214
One must know also how much also we have achieved.

00:25:00.297 --> 00:25:05.878
Then there was another one, Muktananda,
and this 16-year-old fellow - so many of them.

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.923
One by one all of them are finished,

00:25:09.063 --> 00:25:13.298
I would say that it is Shri Krishna's power that has worked.

00:25:13.574 --> 00:25:17.854
Because his lifestyle was, from the very beginning like that was,

00:25:17.938 --> 00:25:22.991
that to kill all those who were negative.

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:33.226
Now, if you see in America, I think, except for one or two leftovers,

00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:35.438
most of them are finished.

00:25:35.518 --> 00:25:38.573
Now, there is one more who will be finished also I'm sure,

00:25:38.633 --> 00:25:43.800
within no time, and we will see that the influence of these

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.304
people, negative people, will be finished.

00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:52.580
As a result of that, as a result of all that,

00:25:52.644 --> 00:25:56.196
what has happened that people have lost faith in anyone.

00:25:56.298 --> 00:26:01.214
They have no faith in anyone. They think if these people

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.412
could deceive us like that, take away our money,

00:26:04.476 --> 00:26:08.800
we have no money even to educate our children,
we have sold our houses,

00:26:08.938 --> 00:26:15.399
so all these things, you see, made them absolutely flabbergasted

00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:21.791
and they decided not to have anything to do with the gurus
who are coming from India -

00:26:21.876 --> 00:26:25.026
and that was against us, in a way.

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:31.189
But all of them, you see, what they did, we should find out, is that,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:37.550
to make a very absurd, queer type of organization.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.798
We are not, we are very normal, absolutely normal people.

00:26:42.932 --> 00:26:48.932
We haven't made any absurd type of religion or absurd type of following

00:26:49.011 --> 00:26:54.849
or absurd type of meditation like you fly in the air and all sorts of things.

00:26:56.026 --> 00:27:06.228
But the people of America are not so matured  to understand  that,

00:27:06.355 --> 00:27:10.429
otherwise they would not have fallen to these horrible gurus.

00:27:10.556 --> 00:27:15.339
So, on one side we have people who are very much affected by these gurus,

00:27:15.403 --> 00:27:20.289
on the other side we have people  who think that also I must be one of them

00:27:20.377 --> 00:27:26.858
and on the third aspect is this,  that the people are extremely simple,

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:31.680
and extremely, I should say immature -

00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:34.778
they are like children.

00:27:34.961 --> 00:27:38.072
So many Americans also told me they are like children

00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:41.747
and to approach them you have to say that

00:27:41.866 --> 00:27:45.871
a Mother's love can only put them right.

00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:52.427
Now, as far as I'm concerned, that was the first country,
I should say, I visited for any programme.

00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:57.359
In 1971, I went there.

00:27:57.454 --> 00:28:03.203
So you can imagine, we got realization on
this Sahasrara Day in 1970  and went

00:28:03.378 --> 00:28:10.279
to America in 1971 and I gave realization to people -
no doubt, to many -

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:19.676
but what I felt was, that they didn't care for deeper things, firstly.

00:28:20.213 --> 00:28:23.871
So we lost many Sahaja Yogis like that.

00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:32.369
Then there were some people who were sick
they wanted their treatment that's all - nothing more.

00:28:32.813 --> 00:28:38.711
Then came some people who were taken away, I should say,

00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:44.791
by other bombastic gurus

00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:49.591
who told them lots of stories and they claimed
so much, so, so many joined them.

00:28:49.805 --> 00:28:56.194
Like that it was, I found that the people were
absolutely not prepared for Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:56.456 --> 00:28:59.826
They were seekers, no doubt, no doubt they were seekers,

00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:03.234
and they had that restlessness of a seeker, no doubt.

00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:09.302
But they were not for Sahaja Yoga -
they didn't know what to seek, what to get.

00:29:09.397 --> 00:29:12.752
That was the part where I felt they were very immature.

00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:17.461
So I, after that I didn't go for 9 years,

00:29:17.683 --> 00:29:20.878
because I thought, better to devote your time to something else

00:29:20.966 --> 00:29:27.304
till these people mature and understand what's wrong with them.

00:29:27.407 --> 00:29:33.050
Now, they had been to gurus and they were lost,
there are some who have this restlessness still.

00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:39.478
I see in many things, the articles they write,
something the books they write,

00:29:39.548 --> 00:29:45.315
that there is this kind of a restlessness - which is very important for Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:46.324 --> 00:29:49.147
Most of you have been seekers in your last lives

00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:53.906
and you had this restlessness within you.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:59.210
But with this restlessness we didn't know what to do,  where to go

00:29:59.282 --> 00:30:03.989
and with that restlessness some people went even up to Japan,

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:08.087
some Australians came up to America, and all kinds of things happened.

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:12.696
That restlessness you cannot describe,

00:30:14.451 --> 00:30:21.106
but these gurus found a good market so
they came down and tried to overpower them.

00:30:22.764 --> 00:30:31.366
With this restlessness you see, it was very reasonable, logical,

00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:34.680
to see that if you go to somebody -

00:30:34.815 --> 00:30:40.258
Do you get rid of your restlessness or not? -
minimum of minimum - but that never happened.

00:30:40.314 --> 00:30:44.745
So when it never happened, you see, they thought that

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.766
this is missing, somebody said, "no you have to have another programme or

00:30:48.814 --> 00:30:52.088
you have to go to another course" - this, that.

00:30:52.168 --> 00:30:57.739
So they went on falling more and more and more.

00:30:58.133 --> 00:31:04.028
At the same time, at the same time, negativity of immorality took place.

00:31:04.401 --> 00:31:09.096
Though if you read the constitution of America you will be amazed.

00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:14.832
In very subtle ways it has just supported complete morality.

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:20.220
I mean, I was surprised, there's a law that when you go out of the house

00:31:20.315 --> 00:31:28.918
you cannot wear funny dresses,
when you are in a swimming suit - also  that is regulated,

00:31:29.013 --> 00:31:31.939
and nobody can be absolutely nude -

00:31:32.002 --> 00:31:36.018
like in Italy, you can find on television

00:31:36.502 --> 00:31:42.019
So, you see, the constitution was made with a great idea of morality -

00:31:42.168 --> 00:31:47.375
I mean the whole basis was, people have to become moral.

00:31:47.479 --> 00:31:51.967
But always if you make any law, human beings have a capacity

00:31:52.063 --> 00:31:58.384
just to sort of blast it - to survive - this law.
I don't want anything

00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:04.180
- and that's how the idea of control started. How can you control it ?

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:07.656
How can you say one should not do like this?

00:32:07.814 --> 00:32:12.520
Now, this explosion started in the family also

00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:17.534
and the children started disobeying the parents.
The parents themselves were of the same style.

00:32:17.646 --> 00:32:23.198
Then the children become the same style, now the whole thing started exploding

00:32:23.357 --> 00:32:26.567
and they thought - there's no freedom.

00:32:26.671 --> 00:32:31.524
Those who don't know how to use freedom - should not get any freedom - I think.

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:38.189
They must know what is freedom is, those who respect freedom
and understand freedom can only be free people.

00:32:38.446 --> 00:32:41.759
So in that freedom, with this explosion, they were thrown away

00:32:41.842 --> 00:32:47.915
and they started taking to lives which were really absolutely absurd,

00:32:48.026 --> 00:32:52.697
calling it most reasonable, most logical.

00:32:54.646 --> 00:33:00.611
So, the people became homosexuals - it's absurd,

00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:04.329
it's not natural at all, it is absolutely absurd.

00:33:04.837 --> 00:33:09.304
But when this idea of freedom exploded in them,

00:33:09.407 --> 00:33:12.844
then all the bhoots came and took over their freedom

00:33:13.352 --> 00:33:16.097
and its from the bhoots they got these ideas,

00:33:16.282 --> 00:33:19.887
and in such a large scale they are taking to this -

00:33:19.942 --> 00:33:22.897
it's very surprising, such a large scale.

00:33:22.933 --> 00:33:26.606
These bhoots are affecting, and people are getting into it.

00:33:26.662 --> 00:33:31.513
As a result of that they started getting all these diseases and all.

00:33:31.648 --> 00:33:34.957
The worst was, I would say, that at that same moment,

00:33:35.036 --> 00:33:40.081
the most negative personality came from Austria - was Freud.

00:33:40.383 --> 00:33:46.279
He was a Jew and he was not respected
by the people of America at that time.

00:33:46.379 --> 00:33:50.053
So he got hold of lots of Jews and all that

00:33:50.076 --> 00:33:54.890
and then he made up this story about the mother and all that

00:33:54.938 --> 00:33:58.268
and he's the one who ruined their lives,

00:33:58.362 --> 00:34:01.360
because as soon as they became free

00:34:01.432 --> 00:34:06.352
they thought, anybody who writes anything black and white is the bible.

00:34:06.463 --> 00:34:11.463
They started following this fellow and some others also from France

00:34:11.542 --> 00:34:17.550
and just it's a sign of complete immaturity -

00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:21.612
a mature person won't take to this or won't take to that.

00:34:21.715 --> 00:34:24.876
I've talked to some Americans, at that time,

00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:29.292
and I mean they were not Sahaja Yogis, not seekers, I think.

00:34:29.363 --> 00:34:32.574
They said "we enjoy every part of life,

00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:38.524
you see we never have any problems -
we enjoy everything, we do this, we do that.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:45.230
The enjoyment is important,
100% of our life is full of enjoyment".

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:47.780
Now, after that phase -

00:34:47.848 --> 00:34:55.987
I think this was so when they came to India
about 1960's or 50's, they were talking like that.

00:34:56.129 --> 00:35:02.430
Now, they are talking about all the problems
they are facing out of these enjoyments.

00:35:02.795 --> 00:35:08.420
They say that 65% people might become schizophrenic,

00:35:08.515 --> 00:35:13.186
30% will become lunatic.

00:35:13.256 --> 00:35:20.449
Means who are left, no more then, I can't understand.
All kinds of statistics you see - you are shocked.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:27.194
How could such a big number of human beings get into trouble of this kind

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:32.762
and the diseases they have is also very funny,

00:35:32.876 --> 00:35:36.664
that they have most of the diseases of Mooladhara,

00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:40.663
where the constitution is based on Mooladhara.

00:35:40.758 --> 00:35:45.258
England has no constitution, no constitution at all,

00:35:45.318 --> 00:35:51.816
but they believe more in Mooladhara than the people in America.

00:35:51.932 --> 00:35:57.173
So, there, because when I was

00:35:57.356 --> 00:36:01.661
like, you see, a wife of a diplomat and all that,

00:36:01.718 --> 00:36:08.718
I found such a wretched temperament these

00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:12.446
ambassadors and all these diplomatic people had.

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:16.279
I couldn't believe, how could they be at the helm of affairs

00:36:16.366 --> 00:36:18.567
and from America, especially you know,

00:36:18.702 --> 00:36:26.954
they would wink at every women and they would twitch on their faces

00:36:27.074 --> 00:36:31.575
and the way they would talk about women was so degrading

00:36:31.663 --> 00:36:37.116
so demeaning and also women would talk about men.

00:36:37.251 --> 00:36:41.764
I told ou the story of the one who came to England
and she wanted to see a pub

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:46.761
and she told me, "Have you visited this particular pub?"
I said, for what?

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.476
And then her two sons, when she went back,

00:36:51.587 --> 00:36:57.112
she told, "we are very free, we have given all freedom
to the children -do what you like".

00:36:57.414 --> 00:37:03.272
And they were celebrating, these two children, were celebrating their birthday

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:07.045
and they had a party with lots of drinks

00:37:07.156 --> 00:37:13.359
and the whole house got burnt,
the children were dead  and the parents were dead -

00:37:13.756 --> 00:37:21.812
She went to see the pub and she had a list of
the interesting pubs that there are in England.

00:37:22.751 --> 00:37:27.222
I mean this interest in the pub itself shows

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:32.689
what sort of a personality she was.
She had two children, she had a husband -

00:37:32.736 --> 00:37:37.830
her husband was a very big man of a very high
repute and all that - and his wife was like that.

00:37:37.909 --> 00:37:42.893
He also used to join her - yes, we gave all freedom to our children,

00:37:42.968 --> 00:37:46.786
we asked them to do what they like, but they must enjoy life.

00:37:46.898 --> 00:37:52.275
Now enjoyment at what point? Where do you enjoy?

00:37:52.473 --> 00:37:56.993
You can enjoy in your heart, you can enjoy in your Sahasrara,

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.466
but with Mooladhara there's no question,

00:38:00.546 --> 00:38:03.850
because if you go on like this there is no end to it

00:38:04.149 --> 00:38:09.084
and that has created now tremendous problems in America.

00:38:09.513 --> 00:38:14.044
I know, I feel very sorry, that was the first country I went to

00:38:14.228 --> 00:38:17.930
because I could see that there are lots of seekers,

00:38:18.137 --> 00:38:24.425
but all of them were not there,
some had gone to this guru, some had gone to that guru.

00:38:24.608 --> 00:38:29.067
And there was one lady, after she came to my programme,

00:38:29.258 --> 00:38:32.358
and she noted down what I was saying

00:38:32.454 --> 00:38:38.538
and she used it for her own purpose and she started teaching Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:39.815 --> 00:38:45.266
Its beyond me, how they are also very money oriented.

00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:49.964
To them, money is success, money is joy, money is everything.

00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:54.477
Now, this third quality, from where did it come I can't say

00:38:54.668 --> 00:38:59.495
but at the time of Shri Krishna, people were very money oriented.

00:39:00.225 --> 00:39:04.066
In the sense that they used to take their milk to sell,

00:39:04.177 --> 00:39:12.802
milk and butter and everything,
to sell in the Kingdom of Kamsa, who was a devil.

00:39:13.083 --> 00:39:17.056
So he used to break their pitchers, so that they need not pay.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.521
But just to make money they would starve their children,

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:26.808
but to make money, they used to take this to the monsters

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.856
because he had lots of armies and things and they needed milk.

00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:36.162
So these women would not give milk to their own children,

00:39:36.289 --> 00:39:41.373
would not give them butter,
but would take all that for these horrible people.

00:39:41.833 --> 00:39:45.047
So that money orientation you see now -

00:39:45.158 --> 00:39:51.043
I mean it is like a shadow and a light.

00:39:51.193 --> 00:39:55.595
If light is Shri Krishna, see what you find in the shadow.

00:39:55.704 --> 00:39:59.378
It's just the other way around, people behave.

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:03.555
He was such a detached person, such a detached person,

00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:12.176
that he can never commit any wrongs, he could not do any immoral things.

00:40:12.542 --> 00:40:16.442
Whatever he did was absolutely moral.

00:40:16.529 --> 00:40:23.109
Because if you are detached and
you are doing something, then nothing touches you.

00:40:24.886 --> 00:40:32.690
He brought in this idea of Leela, of this play, the play of the Divine.

00:40:33.414 --> 00:40:38.023
Now we see in our lives also how the play of Divine works.

00:40:38.238 --> 00:40:41.747
The Sahaja Yogis first when they come they are really restless

00:40:41.843 --> 00:40:45.825
and they go on asking me a hundred questions or

00:40:45.907 --> 00:40:49.758
they start also dominating others, doing all kinds of things.

00:40:49.894 --> 00:40:54.292
But once they get the experience of the Divine power

00:40:54.483 --> 00:40:56.853
then they start settling down.

00:40:57.004 --> 00:41:03.073
Now then they see that there are so many coincidences that happen,

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:07.934
so many miracles that happen, then they start understanding

00:41:08.093 --> 00:41:12.290
that there is some power which is looking after us,

00:41:12.393 --> 00:41:16.300
which is guiding us, which is taking us to the right path.

00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:22.614
So, unless and until this happens,
that this understanding, even before realization,

00:41:22.694 --> 00:41:28.614
if people start getting this realization
that there is a power that is helping us,

00:41:28.789 --> 00:41:33.825
something beyond what we know, then things will start changing.

00:41:34.322 --> 00:41:39.301
Now, we have to work out in America, we have to tell them,

00:41:39.453 --> 00:41:42.558
and we have to tell that, this is the power

00:41:42.677 --> 00:41:48.025
that is beyond, is wanting to transform you.

00:41:48.216 --> 00:41:51.584
There is going to be a global transformation,

00:41:51.686 --> 00:41:56.907
I can see it so clearly now, in every country I go I see this,

00:41:57.282 --> 00:42:03.302
that it works, it works - whether it is a Turkish country,

00:42:03.374 --> 00:42:09.189
or it is Tunisia or if it is Russia - any country I go to,

00:42:09.332 --> 00:42:12.448
all those people who come, it works,

00:42:12.551 --> 00:42:17.786
this global transformation - I never thought I would be able to see it in my lifetime.

00:42:17.897 --> 00:42:23.389
But it has really reached it's highest,

00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:29.360
I would say I think so, is the highest point of development.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:34.344
So you are all transformed,

00:42:34.558 --> 00:42:37.094
this was predicted,

00:42:37.237 --> 00:42:42.671
a long time back in India, and also I must say,
it must have been predicted somewhere else also.

00:42:42.803 --> 00:42:48.485
Now when you start feeling the vibrations and you start using it,

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.786
then you understand that there is this power that works,

00:42:53.078 --> 00:42:58.695
now then you start seeing energy centres of Swayambu's and all that -

00:42:58.799 --> 00:43:01.394
then you start understanding this.

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:04.678
It goes on, your understanding increasing

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:10.967
but first thing is that they have to believe that there is a power beyond.

00:43:11.086 --> 00:43:13.694
They may not believe in Kundalini, it doesn't matter,

00:43:13.854 --> 00:43:18.931
but once you know that there is a power beyond then they'll try to work it out.

00:43:19.142 --> 00:43:25.322
And this is what is very very difficult to convince people, that there is a power behind.

00:43:25.449 --> 00:43:31.523
Because they are so conditioned by Science, also by their family traditions,

00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:38.766
also all nonsensical ideas about ego, that they cannot see,

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:42.834
that's the point is, that the nature is helping.

00:43:42.945 --> 00:43:47.159
Now, why America is such a rich country, why?

00:43:47.263 --> 00:43:49.677
They never ask such a question - Why is it so rich?

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.641
What have they done? What are their punyas?

00:43:52.753 --> 00:43:56.776
Now, one of the reasons is that Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:43:57.141 --> 00:44:02.159
He's doing his job, I should say,

00:44:02.358 --> 00:44:07.131
he's working it out. But people not understanding that

00:44:07.273 --> 00:44:12.621
this is a Divine blessing they think that this is their right to have it and

00:44:12.769 --> 00:44:16.235
they boast about it, they are very boastful people,

00:44:16.394 --> 00:44:20.137
they talk about their own wealth, they'll talk about everything,

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:26.065
it's a very different situation and a culture.

00:44:27.851 --> 00:44:30.646
For an Indian, if somebody starts boasting about

00:44:30.748 --> 00:44:36.311
his wealth, they would think
he must be mad and coming from a lunatic asylum

00:44:36.613 --> 00:44:39.469
because it is regarded as bad manners.

00:44:39.557 --> 00:44:42.453
So there is nothing like bad manners, you see,

00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:47.713
in the west as it is, but the worst is in America.

00:44:48.063 --> 00:44:52.320
I mean they can abuse their father with a very dirty word,

00:44:52.446 --> 00:44:56.181
all the time they are using, even the judges. I was...

00:44:56.313 --> 00:45:03.233
I saw one film in which a judge used a dirty word,
I did not know much of that meaning,

00:45:03.305 --> 00:45:05.463
but it was not a good word that he used.

00:45:05.552 --> 00:45:12.152
So they become sort of, what's wrong, type of people with this arrogance.

00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:16.718
I don't know how we are going to convince them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:16.871 --> 00:45:22.946
I'm going to try also something like approaching these top class people

00:45:23.145 --> 00:45:25.436
to talk to them about it.

00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:28.153
Maybe, you see, they might feel influenced

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:32.862
that these top class people have taken to it,
so there must be something about Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:33.083 --> 00:45:36.156
I wonder if they would talk about us so much -

00:45:36.226 --> 00:45:40.412
what Sahaja Yoga is, what it can do to this country.

00:45:40.508 --> 00:45:43.805
Because we have to save, really save this country.

00:45:43.961 --> 00:45:49.335
It is from all the sides, is under attack - from all the sides.

00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:52.847
You take morality part, it is under attack,

00:45:52.942 --> 00:45:57.199
you take from the artist’s point of view, it is under attack.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:01.340
They are not creating many artists there, I went to see

00:46:01.539 --> 00:46:04.253
their paintings there, their latest paintings

00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:09.442
with modern painting and all that -

00:46:09.657 --> 00:46:11.551
they haven't got the depth at all.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:18.670
It's all full of filthy things about it and they talk about absolutely filthy things.

00:46:19.233 --> 00:46:24.014
There is one artist from India,

00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:29.153
he went to America, and when I saw his paintings I was surprised.

00:46:29.609 --> 00:46:33.310
I said "What are you doing?", he said "This is what sells here".

00:46:33.501 --> 00:46:35.916
I said "And what about India?", he said "No, no,

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.609
they will never touch it, it's horrible".

00:46:38.681 --> 00:46:42.046
He himself knows, but he said this will sell here,

00:46:42.141 --> 00:46:44.679
so he has made it like that.

00:46:45.045 --> 00:46:51.517
It's a point of judgement,

00:46:51.652 --> 00:46:56.049
whether you think it is worth selling or not, is the point.

00:46:56.161 --> 00:47:00.790
Now whom do you sell to these people who are not mature enough,

00:47:00.909 --> 00:47:04.397
who are so much enticed by the Mooladhara problem,

00:47:04.508 --> 00:47:08.371
how can you help them? How can you bring them around?

00:47:08.507 --> 00:47:15.742
It is a question of people maturing

00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:20.008
for which of course this Paramchaitanya will help, I am sure,

00:47:20.088 --> 00:47:23.155
the way yesterday you felt it, I'm sure,

00:47:23.235 --> 00:47:26.088
Paramchaitanya has to do something about it,

00:47:26.215 --> 00:47:27.691
it has to work it out,

00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:33.403
it has to enter into different...

00:47:34.653 --> 00:47:37.535
dimensions in human beings to understand.

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:40.955
Like creating coincidences and all that

00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:46.949
and then bringing them down to Sahaja Yoga.
It can work out, no doubt.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:53.226
Also Sahaja Yogis must work there, I know there are very few,

00:47:53.317 --> 00:47:55.960
and that's why they were upset about it  because

00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:58.813
they were really working very hard

00:47:58.988 --> 00:48:04.221
and it didn't work out there so they feel that
there is something basically wrong.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.948
I have told you already what is wrong with them, is this,

00:48:08.048 --> 00:48:13.548
that they lack maturity as far as evolution is concerned.

00:48:13.746 --> 00:48:18.778
Even those who have come now to Sahaja Yoga have done very well.

00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:23.504
There are, of course, some who would not get so much of it.

00:48:23.662 --> 00:48:30.512
So what you have to do is to get to reality,

00:48:30.588 --> 00:48:35.358
to know what the problem is really and what we can do about it.

00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:41.388
Now, so many European leaders, or you can say European Sahaja Yogis

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:46.719
are free because I am not going there  to Europe,

00:48:46.803 --> 00:48:51.050
so they should take charge also and can go sometimes

00:48:51.146 --> 00:48:58.146
and have some sort of a programme or find some conference, or whatever,

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:03.524
and get in contact with them and talk to them in such a manner

00:49:03.683 --> 00:49:09.493
that they do feel that this is something very remarkable.

00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:13.330
Something very much what they wanted,

00:49:13.464 --> 00:49:19.714
something that is the future of the whole world.

00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:23.887
So this global transformation is taking place

00:49:23.943 --> 00:49:27.244
and you have to talk on those lines a little strongly.

00:49:27.363 --> 00:49:30.195
But with media we had very bad experiences

00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:34.092
because we arranged a hall and we spent a lot of money there

00:49:34.195 --> 00:49:37.711
and not one person came from media, not one.

00:49:37.854 --> 00:49:39.584
So we did not know what to do,

00:49:39.687 --> 00:49:44.034
we had prepared so much food and everything was wasted,

00:49:44.137 --> 00:49:46.498
not one person from the media came.

00:49:46.675 --> 00:49:52.375
So also we can start a kind of a newspaper, could be,

00:49:52.537 --> 00:49:58.398
it could be some sort of a media of having cable TV

00:49:58.469 --> 00:50:02.737
or something like that by which we can propagate Sahaja Yoga

00:50:02.823 --> 00:50:06.640
and tell them what good it has done and what it can do.

00:50:06.736 --> 00:50:12.860
It's quite a mad place because they have so many books,

00:50:12.963 --> 00:50:17.348
everything is so much, every number is so much,

00:50:17.527 --> 00:50:21.397
that if you write a book also I do not know whether it will be lost.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:25.396
Now for today, I have to announce that my book is ready now,

00:50:25.468 --> 00:50:29.297
I have done it and I would like to publish it now

00:50:29.455 --> 00:50:34.246
so that it will be available to you and I'm sure you will enjoy it.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:39.164
Not only that but it will help you to understand the problems of the west.

00:50:39.358 --> 00:50:42.130
I have not dealt in that the problems of the east

00:50:42.249 --> 00:50:46.503
but I have dealt in that with the problems of the west,

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:51.374
what problems they have and how to tackle them.

00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:57.685
So this book they will be bringing now and showing you.

00:50:57.859 --> 00:51:05.427
We will see how it is published and how people like it,

00:51:06.293 --> 00:51:09.191
that part I will do.

00:51:24.509 --> 00:51:29.295
I would say that I would not have liked
to write a book like that, to be very frank,

00:51:29.517 --> 00:51:35.493
because for a person like me
I should only write all the splendour of spirituality,

00:51:35.636 --> 00:51:39.871
all the beauty of heavens, everything, all poetic things,

00:51:39.966 --> 00:51:45.954
but I thought reality is very different  and people must be told what is the reality.

00:51:46.089 --> 00:51:50.304
So, I have ventured to write this, otherwise I would have liked to write something

00:51:50.479 --> 00:51:54.776
like Amrutananya written by Jyaneshwara,

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.137
but there's no controversy, nothing, just sweetness

00:51:58.225 --> 00:52:02.038
and just overflowing compassion, I would have been very happy,

00:52:02.141 --> 00:52:08.512
but that doesn't work out you see, it will float in the air I think.

00:52:08.663 --> 00:52:13.749
So I thought first I muswrite this book
and point out where are we wrong

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:16.785
and to make you aware of it.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.366
Then what we can do is to have another book, I could have,

00:52:21.477 --> 00:52:25.152
with all my experiences with Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.843
It would be another interesting thing.

00:52:40.372 --> 00:52:45.853
One of the defects of these incarnations is that

00:52:45.901 --> 00:52:48.712
they never wrote a book themselves.

00:52:49.348 --> 00:52:53.315
You see Christ never wrote any book,
Krishna never wrote any book,

00:52:53.474 --> 00:52:54.849
Rama never wrote any book.

00:52:54.886 --> 00:52:57.898
They knew how to read and write but they never wrote.

00:52:58.065 --> 00:53:02.331
And then we have people; like Nanaka, who has written,

00:53:02.442 --> 00:53:09.586
not himself so much but he has compiled
all the great literature of the realized souls.

00:53:09.768 --> 00:53:17.729
Alright, then still what happens is something that they just read it

00:53:17.844 --> 00:53:24.004
word by word then they have to finish it in 2½ days the whole thing.

00:53:24.164 --> 00:53:27.698
So one person reads it puts the finger at one point, finished,

00:53:27.786 --> 00:53:31.647
then another one comes, starts from there,
puts the finger here, it is finished.

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.723
Nothing goes in the head, you see that's the problem with it.

00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:37.893
The same with Mohammed Sahib, he never wrote the book.

00:53:38.021 --> 00:53:41.562
If he had himself written the book it would have been very different

00:53:41.736 --> 00:53:45.004
but somebody else in the 5th calipher,

00:53:45.081 --> 00:53:48.167
who was a very cruel and a bad man, who wrote it.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.225
The same thing has happened with the bible.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:57.167
So you see it's like such a great diamond is put in the mud

00:53:57.349 --> 00:54:01.368
and everywhere there are complications because of this.

00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:04.732
You cannot blame these great people,

00:54:05.058 --> 00:54:09.654
but only thing that is happening is all bad name is coming to them.

00:54:09.773 --> 00:54:12.469
They are not the ones who wrote anything wrong,

00:54:12.565 --> 00:54:15.146
they are not the ones who would say anything wrong,

00:54:15.273 --> 00:54:18.915
but if the book falls into the hands of some people

00:54:19.073 --> 00:54:26.293
who are absolutely adharmic, who are cruel,
then this is what happens.

00:54:26.642 --> 00:54:31.336
Now, you see what's happening with the Catholic Church, you see what's happening with Muslims.

00:54:31.498 --> 00:54:35.636
Everywhere you find there is violence, there's corruption

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.528
and there's fighting - this is no religion,

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:42.160
nobody could have preached that thing -
but it is doing that way.

00:54:42.264 --> 00:54:47.141
So now you all stand out,
out of all this where you love each other,

00:54:47.269 --> 00:54:50.994
you care for each other,
you enjoy everything, despite that,

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:54.244
your enjoyment is absolutely pure

00:54:54.578 --> 00:54:59.863
and this is what is to be seen by others and it can work out.

00:55:00.029 --> 00:55:05.993
I'm sure, one day in America, we will be there very successful.

00:55:06.311 --> 00:55:10.199
MAY GOD BLESS YOU!!!

02:32:13.089 --> 02:32:15.953
This  is the book

02:32:16.454 --> 02:32:20.255
it looks big, but what would  be when it is printed [UNCLEAR]

02:32:20.464 --> 02:32:25.165
is going  to offer

02:32:28.329 --> 02:32:30.429
to all the sahaja yogis

02:32:31.223 --> 02:32:34.496
so that they  read and find out what is wrong

02:32:34.719 --> 02:32:38.758
and what we have to do

02:32:59.133 --> 02:33:02.799
In the preface I have written

02:33:04.029 --> 02:33:08.500
Actually I did not want to write a book of this kind.

02:33:08.659 --> 02:33:12.823
I am a person who is in complete joy of Divinity.

02:33:13.095 --> 02:33:15.952
These is  all pervading joy of Divine love

02:33:16.217 --> 02:33:18.831
and I wanted everyone to enjoy it.

02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:23.388
Specially in the West I saw there are many seekers of Truth.

02:33:23.439 --> 02:33:28.949
There are many scientists who have written voluminous books about consciousness, about awareness.

02:33:29.056 --> 02:33:31.326
One can give a list of them.

02:33:31.517 --> 02:33:34.521
But all these books really weary you completely,

02:33:34.577 --> 02:33:37.787
because they do not emit any knowledge of the ultimate truth.

02:33:37.978 --> 02:33:40.544
I don’t want to criticise them;

02:33:40.632 --> 02:33:47.294
after all whatever they are doing constitutes honest research.

02:33:51.453 --> 02:33:56.659
But why not also give a chance to this new discovery which is being made?

02:33:56.762 --> 02:34:03.813
Why not humble down to see what is beyond
this mind which gives you all this artificial intelligence?

02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:17.615
It is extremely difficult for me to write about the problems of Western life.

02:34:17.703 --> 02:34:20.334
It is like a tree which has grown outside.

02:34:20.414 --> 02:34:25.418
This is how to be pushed down now to the roots and made to grow inside.

02:34:25.497 --> 02:34:32.232
It is only by going deep inside that we can find out
what the problems of Western civilisation are

02:34:32.377 --> 02:34:35.136
This book is especially meant for the Western people

02:34:35.256 --> 02:34:39.430
But  unfortunately I have never studied any Western language before.

02:34:40.458 --> 02:34:46.050
English is one of the blessings of the British given to India when they ruled our country.

02:34:46.130 --> 02:34:51.753
But there too, unfortunately, I studied in a vernacular school and later on in a medical college

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.566
where there was no question of learning this language,

02:34:54.701 --> 02:35:00.689
English, which is today universally accepted, especially in the West,

02:35:02.768 --> 02:35:05.529
especially in the West.

02:35:06.966 --> 02:35:12.776
This book is no way to show any flowery language or to show any literary talent of mine.

02:35:12.895 --> 02:35:16.629
It is just a straightforward statement of facts which I know and

02:35:16.734 --> 02:35:19.816
which I want to communicate with the Western world.

02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:25.525
I would request people not to waste their time in finding faults with my English

02:35:25.614 --> 02:35:28.873
because that  is not my Mother tongue and I never studied it.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:35.901
Unfortunately, I could not get anybody else to write for me
because it had to be written by me personally.

02:35:36.118 --> 02:35:41.932
The most difficult part is to convince a human being that in the entire creation,

02:35:42.024 --> 02:35:44.005
he is the most highly evolved being;

02:35:44.108 --> 02:35:49.711
that he is capable of becoming a glorious personality,
a beautiful, peaceful angel.

02:35:49.839 --> 02:35:52.539
To tell him about the problems of modern times

02:35:52.610 --> 02:36:00.578
is not a very good way of convincing him
about what human beings truly are.

02:36:01.413 --> 02:36:04.769
There has been so much demeaning of human beings,

02:36:04.825 --> 02:36:07.438
so much of degradation in their value system

02:36:07.518 --> 02:36:11.147
that I thought that unless I go to the root of the problems,

02:36:11.249 --> 02:36:18.302
it won’t be easy to explain why they should
break away from their present shackles

02:36:19.465 --> 02:36:21.560
in order to evolve and ascend.

02:36:21.682 --> 02:36:26.788
One has to speak frankly what the problems
are and what the real solutions are.

02:36:28.039 --> 02:36:31.874
Frankly, there is no peace within modern human beings nor without.

02:36:32.026 --> 02:36:34.504
The poor and the rich alike are unhappy.

02:36:34.579 --> 02:36:37.255
Everywhere people are groping for solutions.

02:36:37.383 --> 02:36:46.419
At artifical  level, the intellect can work out certain
problems about things that we see around us in jeopardy.

02:36:46.721 --> 02:36:51.266
But while a few problems may be resolved in this way, others arise.

02:36:51.507 --> 02:36:55.789
The true solution lies not in the material circumstances outside

02:36:56.022 --> 02:36:59.633
human beings but inside the human beings

02:37:03.039 --> 02:37:05.342
inside the human beings themselves.

02:37:05.406 --> 02:37:11.445
True and lasting solution to present ills can be found only

02:37:11.794 --> 02:37:16.127
by inner, collective transformation of human beings.

02:37:16.375 --> 02:37:18.085
This is not an impossibility.

02:37:18.157 --> 02:37:20.434
In fact it has already happened.

02:37:20.529 --> 02:37:23.483
There are so many thousands and thousands...

02:37:23.658 --> 02:37:26.848
There are so many thousands and thousands

02:37:26.888 --> 02:37:29.688
who have actually achieved this state.

02:37:30.319 --> 02:37:34.015
The reality of en-masse inner ‘transformation of human beings

02:37:34.056 --> 02:37:39.444
by self-realisation is the most revolutionary discovery of the present age.

02:37:39.606 --> 02:37:43.708
But so far, very few governments have accepted this discovery,

02:37:43.797 --> 02:37:53.303
especially in America, England, France, Italy and Germany.

02:37:53.414 --> 02:37:58.276
The Pope, who himself is supposed to be in charge of religion,
meets all false gurus,

02:37:58.356 --> 02:38:00.895
but he will never meet me or talk to me,

02:38:00.988 --> 02:38:05.204
though I have met him before he was elected to this position of a Pope.

02:38:05.297 --> 02:38:08.072
This is not my job, this is not my work,

02:38:08.170 --> 02:38:14.119
but it is a spontaneous desire of the Divine
that this should be brought in full light,

02:38:14.526 --> 02:38:20.020
in full light, so that human beings are raised to a higher state of consciousness

02:38:20.076 --> 02:38:22.107
by which they can realise

02:38:22.186 --> 02:38:27.019
what they are, so that they can appreciate and glorify themselves.

02:38:27.207 --> 02:38:31.407
To me,  human beings are like the deities who are still in stone form

02:38:31.582 --> 02:38:35.467
and who can be transformed, with Kundalini awakening, into angels.

02:38:35.587 --> 02:38:38.384
I wish  with this book I will not hurt people.

02:38:38.544 --> 02:38:44.286
On the contrary, I hope to be able to get many
more people in this great work of Sahaja Yoga,

02:38:44.350 --> 02:38:46.598
by which they can achieve the ultimate.

02:38:46.678 --> 02:38:50.515
I have to use humour, because by nature I am very humourous

02:38:50.611 --> 02:38:56.671
and I see humour in every kind of incident,
which people sometimes take very seriously.

02:38:56.850 --> 02:39:00.326
It is too much for a Mother to talk about the ills of her children,

02:39:00.497 --> 02:39:05.515
but unless and until that is faced, I don’t think the children can ever get

02:39:06.182 --> 02:39:11.363
their benevolence and reach the ultimate goal, which is their self-realisation.

02:39:11.538 --> 02:39:14.749
So I would ask all of you not to get angry with me,

02:39:14.789 --> 02:39:18.649
but to understand that out of my tremendous compassion and love,

02:39:18.769 --> 02:39:21.945
I have written this book for the benevolence of the people,

02:39:22.001 --> 02:39:28.260
with whatever English I can use, with whatever literature I can use,
with whatever style I could adopt.
