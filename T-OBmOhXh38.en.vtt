00:12.352 --> 00:19.781
Now this left-hand side of the heart is
concerned with your mother

00:19.982 --> 00:29.048
and with Shiva, the existence. You get
your existence through your mother.

00:29.249 --> 00:36.266
And Shiva and Parvati they are your
parents, both of them, are your parents,

00:36.467 --> 00:41.273
as far as your existence is concerned.

00:41.834 --> 00:49.414
And it is such a beautiful center is your
heart center.

00:49.615 --> 00:53.867
You want somebody to do something
for you, try this.

00:54.068 --> 00:57.593
You want that somebody should yield
or something,

00:57.794 --> 00:59.734
you find somebody very obstinate, I mean

00:59.935 --> 01:03.313
I have told you that you can beat them
with shoes, do all those things.

01:03.514 --> 01:06.281
But there’s a very simple way if you know
how to do it:

01:06.482 --> 01:13.360
you see, you just think of their Hriday,
their heart, and put a bandhan to that.

01:13.561 --> 01:19.211
And you can do it so beautifully. You can
melt a person

01:19.412 --> 01:23.539
without any difficulties if you know how
to handle their heart.

01:23.740 --> 01:27.328
You have to appeal to their heart.

01:27.529 --> 01:34.783
And that’s the best attraction, I tell you,
and the best secret method by which

01:34.984 --> 01:39.060
you can bring good in them when you are
talking to somebody.

01:39.261 --> 01:43.807
Supposing I, now - intellectually if I
start quarrelling with you,

01:44.008 --> 01:48.386
you will give Me up in no time! But I have
to use your heart power

01:48.587 --> 01:52.684
and I have to enter into your heart, and
that is how it works.

01:52.885 --> 01:55.581
So always when you want to do something
like that,

01:55.782 --> 01:59.971
just humble down yourself in your heart,
that is first.

02:00.172 --> 02:03.355
First of all you must humble down yourself
in your heart.

02:03.556 --> 02:06.052
And from there work on the heart of other.

02:06.253 --> 02:11.752
Just put a bandhan and you will see,
a person will melt away.

02:11.953 --> 02:15.221
We melt our intelligence, our ego,

02:15.422 --> 02:18.511
everything, even your superego, in your
heart.

02:18.712 --> 02:22.160
So it’s a very easy thing if you know
how to approach people

02:22.361 --> 02:30.472
through their heart. And that is only
possible if you are genuine,

02:30.673 --> 02:35.872
because genuineness is something
that a heart recognizes.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.956
You can befool a person with your
cunning methods,

02:39.157 --> 02:43.636
but the heart will recognize it later on,
and the person will hate you.

02:43.837 --> 02:45.706
Even if you talk to someone, “Oh, thank
you very much,

02:45.907 --> 02:48.065
oh, very good, thank you very much,
very nice.”

02:48.266 --> 02:52.042
And the heart knows: “Oh, he is trying
to befool me and he is very cunning.”

02:52.250 --> 02:54.823
The heart is going to hate such a person.

02:55.024 --> 02:58.902
And heart has the eyes to see and feel
the person.

02:59.103 --> 03:01.513
So if you could appeal to somebody’s heart

03:01.714 --> 03:06.325
and put a bandhan on the heart you can
melt that person.

03:06.526 --> 03:10.933
And if you love someone and if you want
that person should be corrected -

03:11.134 --> 03:13.549
supposing such a person is a drunkard,

03:13.750 --> 03:16.565
or a person who beats you and is torturing
you,

03:16.781 --> 03:21.761
because he’s under the spell of some drugs
or some sort of a foreign thing -

03:21.962 --> 03:28.802
then you just put bandhan to his heart
and you will see, they’ll be changing.

03:29.011 --> 03:32.324
They’ll be changing very fast. And that’s
why you say “change of heart”.

03:32.525 --> 03:35.582
Everywhere you’ll find, in every scripture
it is written,

03:35.783 --> 03:38.816
change of heart is needed, not the change
of clothes.

03:39.017 --> 03:43.152
So it’s not intellectual changing, but -
or rational changing,

03:43.353 --> 03:49.708
but it is the change of heart, and that is
brought about by moving

03:49.909 --> 03:56.152
the heart chakra on the right-hand side
in the clockwise manner -

03:56.353 --> 03:59.784
that is the heart itself, in the clockwise
manner.

03:59.985 --> 04:03.722
If you can do that, you can really do
marvels.

04:03.923 --> 04:10.628
And that’s how, on a collective basis,
the heart is sort of the innermost,

04:10.829 --> 04:19.362
innermost string of the collective; one
string that is passing through all of us.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.645
So if you could strike at the innermost -

04:21.846 --> 04:26.620
because in a 3 and 1\2 circle that’s
the innermost point -

04:26.821 --> 04:30.019
if you touch there, it passes over this.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.550
Supposing you touch somewhere else
then it might break.

04:33.751 --> 04:37.057
But at the beginning if you start striking
it, it goes

04:37.258 --> 04:43.357
very nicely and passes into complete
circumference.

04:43.558 --> 04:47.978
Now the center one I have told you is
the heart plexus,

04:48.179 --> 04:52.721
which we call as cardiac plexus, and
it has got ten (twelve) sub-plexuses.

04:52.922 --> 04:54.968
And the English names for that I will,

04:55.169 --> 04:58.039
again I’m going to give you the complete
list. I don’t know when will I have time

04:58.240 --> 05:01.265
to go through the medical journal, but
I’ll find out all of them.

05:01.466 --> 05:05.461
And I’m going to tell you what they call it
in the medical terminology.

05:05.662 --> 05:09.851
But they know that there are ten (twelve)
sub-plexuses which are supplying

05:10.052 --> 05:14.197
to the muscles of the heart, to the lungs
and to the right-side lungs

05:14.398 --> 05:19.049
and that’s how they divide it. But they do
not know that it is already three parts

05:19.250 --> 05:23.134
and then there are ten petals which
are working it out –

05:23.335 --> 05:25.760
I’m sorry, twelve petals that are working
it out.

05:25.961 --> 05:30.416
So three divided into twelve is four each
side.

05:30.617 --> 05:33.612
But actually it is not so.

05:33.813 --> 05:41.219
It is the twelve petals are together
in the center,

05:41.420 --> 05:47.538
and the center one is known as
the “sacred heart”.

05:47.739 --> 05:56.941
In the Bible it is called as “sacred heart”
and this, the sacredness of that heart

05:57.142 --> 06:03.510
in the abstract form is the motherly love
of God.

06:03.711 --> 06:07.758
That’s why the Jagadamba, the Mother
of the Universe, resides in that place.

06:07.959 --> 06:15.281
And these, those twelve petals act
according to the Mother of the heart,

06:15.482 --> 06:18.484
and that’s why we cannot allot them
to this side or that side,

06:18.685 --> 06:22.967
because it is She who actually makes them
pulsate.

06:23.168 --> 06:28.765
So here She becomes the dominant person
and not the heart. There the Spirit rules.

06:28.966 --> 06:33.187
So Spirit has rules by itself, and it is
ruled

06:33.388 --> 06:40.621
with the help of the reflection of God
Almighty Himself.

06:40.822 --> 06:46.371
It is on its own, it is arbitrary. It sees,
it watches, it is the witness.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.481
It watches the play of these ten petals –
twelve petals here.

06:50.682 --> 06:56.474
But if it finds that there’s too much
of strain on the center one,

06:56.675 --> 07:02.826
it just switches off. And when it’s
switched off the whole thing stops.

07:03.027 --> 07:08.896
You see? So you must understand the
difference between the other, other chakras

07:09.097 --> 07:14.466
and this one is, that there is the Spirit
on one side

07:14.667 --> 07:17.295
and the Mother on the other side,
and on the other side

07:17.496 --> 07:24.527
is a human perfect personality. Three
things altogether.

07:24.728 --> 07:27.957
Now, if you reduce them to our three
powers, you’d understand it.

07:28.158 --> 07:32.810
On one side is the instrument, or you
can say

07:33.011 --> 07:38.675
the nucleus for the left-hand side working.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.784
In the center it is,

07:40.985 --> 07:44.591
or you can say the left-hand side working,
you can say the Mahakali’s working.

07:44.792 --> 07:48.590
In the center, you can say, it is for
the Mahalakshmi working.

07:48.791 --> 07:55.060
And the nucleus for the working
of the right-hand side

07:55.261 --> 07:59.864
is in the heart, on the right-hand side
where Rama resides.

08:00.065 --> 08:05.020
Because we can call it a nucleus. The
reason is He was active, He was active

08:05.221 --> 08:09.661
without feeling, without feeling
the witness state.

08:09.862 --> 08:16.925
Now they combined here where Krishna came
and He felt the witness state.

08:17.126 --> 08:19.948
And He called it as Leela, is the whole
play.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.965
Rama never called it as play, but He
called it as play.

08:24.166 --> 08:29.895
So that’s why Krishna here is completed
and that’s why we call Him a Sampurna,

08:30.096 --> 08:34.510
is a complete incarnation, at here.

08:35.110 --> 08:37.472
(…) But now, this coming back to the heart
again.

08:37.673 --> 08:40.792
On the right-hand side we have got Rama’s
place.

08:40.993 --> 08:48.284
Now Rama was known for His obedience
to His father, if you know His story.

08:48.485 --> 08:55.339
His father was in Ayodhya, he was ruling
there, and he had three wives.

08:55.540 --> 09:01.621
The third wife had no – I mean, she had
two sons,

09:01.822 --> 09:06.769
but she could not see Rama getting
the throne.

09:06.970 --> 09:09.550
She was a very nice mother, but somebody,
you see,

09:09.751 --> 09:11.508
some lady went and told something to her

09:11.709 --> 09:15.245
and she listened to her and she told
her husband that,

09:15.446 --> 09:20.331
“If you want to give me my boon,
the promised boon,

09:20.532 --> 09:25.074
you have to make Rama go into the jungle
for fourteen years,

09:25.275 --> 09:30.539
and give the throne to my son Bharat.”

09:32.492 --> 09:39.448
And when Dashratha heard this, he fainted,
he fainted with this request.

09:39.649 --> 09:42.004
But Rama was there, He heard it

09:42.205 --> 09:46.332
and He immediately told her that “I’m going
to the forest and I’ve accepted it.

09:46.533 --> 09:49.612
And you appoint your son as the Bharat,
for me, it’s alright.”

09:49.813 --> 09:54.005
And that’s how He went, you see. Just
to obey the order of His father,

09:54.205 --> 09:57.839
because father had not even ordered,
but because he was compelled.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.503
He had given his wife two boons,

10:00.704 --> 10:04.019
that once you see, in a war she saved
his life, so he said that

10:04.220 --> 10:06.933
“Whenever you want, you can ask
for these two boons.”

10:07.134 --> 10:10.737
And they were, she never knew that she
would use them in such a funny way.

10:10.938 --> 10:14.770
Later on she repented, because Bharata
came and He refused to accept the throne

10:14.971 --> 10:19.152
and he put only Rama’s slippers there and
ruled there, and everything was different.

10:19.353 --> 10:25.238
But Dashratha died, because when Rama
went away, he just died.

10:25.439 --> 10:32.511
So you see, Rama’s life shows how
He was obedient

10:32.712 --> 10:36.353
to His parents. He suffered so much.

10:36.554 --> 10:41.044
Anyone who has not been respectful
to his parents…

10:41.245 --> 10:49.544
You see, if your parents have been unkind,
you have every right

10:49.745 --> 10:51.730
to tell them that they should not be unkind
to you

10:51.931 --> 10:58.481
and that you feel hurt, but you have
no business to answer them back

10:58.682 --> 11:01.966
and you have to be respectful, you have
to be respectful

11:02.167 --> 11:06.605
because they represent your primordial
parents.

11:06.806 --> 11:11.801
You are not to shout at them and misbehave.
You have to be respectful to them.

11:12.002 --> 11:15.271
They may be bad people, but you have
to respect them,

11:15.472 --> 11:19.732
because you have chosen them. When you
were born, you chose them.

11:19.933 --> 11:23.847
You could not have been born to them,
you have really chosen them

11:24.048 --> 11:27.015
and you said, “These are going to be
my parents.”

11:27.216 --> 11:31.927
So if they are your parents, they are there
because of certain reasons,

11:32.128 --> 11:33.610
because you have been seeking them

11:33.811 --> 11:37.201
in your previous lives and that’s how
you are there.

11:37.402 --> 11:41.279
(…) You’re not to boss over them,
it’s real, I’m telling you the secret.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.982
Is not for anything for you see, to make
you change your ways or anything,

11:46.183 --> 11:48.505
but I’m just telling you the secret because
you have lost

11:48.706 --> 11:53.161
the idea of the secretive methods
of winning over people

11:53.362 --> 11:57.588
and understanding them and managing them,
and really you will have your way.

11:57.789 --> 12:01.038
Only thing is to respect them.
