00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:19.781
Now this left-hand side of the heart is
concerned with your mother

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:29.048
and with Shiva, the existence. You get
your existence through your mother.

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:36.266
And Shiva and Parvati they are your
parents, both of them, are your parents,

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:41.273
as far as your existence is concerned.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:49.414
And it is such a beautiful center is your
heart center.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.867
You want somebody to do something
for you, try this.

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:57.593
You want that somebody should yield
or something,

00:00:57.794 --> 00:00:59.734
you find somebody very obstinate, I mean

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.313
I have told you that you can beat them
with shoes, do all those things.

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:06.281
But there’s a very simple way if you know
how to do it:

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:13.360
you see, you just think of their Hriday,
their heart, and put a bandhan to that.

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:19.211
And you can do it so beautifully. You can
melt a person

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:23.539
without any difficulties if you know how
to handle their heart.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.328
You have to appeal to their heart.

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:34.783
And that’s the best attraction, I tell you,
and the best secret method by which

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:39.060
you can bring good in them when you are
talking to somebody.

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:43.807
Supposing I, now - intellectually if I
start quarrelling with you,

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:48.386
you will give Me up in no time! But I have
to use your heart power

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:52.684
and I have to enter into your heart, and
that is how it works.

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:55.581
So always when you want to do something
like that,

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.971
just humble down yourself in your heart,
that is first.

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:03.355
First of all you must humble down yourself
in your heart.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.052
And from there work on the heart of other.

00:02:06.253 --> 00:02:11.752
Just put a bandhan and you will see,
a person will melt away.

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:15.221
We melt our intelligence, our ego,

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:18.511
everything, even your superego, in your
heart.

00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:22.160
So it’s a very easy thing if you know
how to approach people

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:30.472
through their heart. And that is only
possible if you are genuine,

00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:35.872
because genuineness is something
that a heart recognizes.

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.956
You can befool a person with your
cunning methods,

00:02:39.157 --> 00:02:43.636
but the heart will recognize it later on,
and the person will hate you.

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:45.706
Even if you talk to someone, “Oh, thank
you very much,

00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:48.065
oh, very good, thank you very much,
very nice.”

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:52.042
And the heart knows: “Oh, he is trying
to befool me and he is very cunning.”

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.823
The heart is going to hate such a person.

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:58.902
And heart has the eyes to see and feel
the person.

00:02:59.103 --> 00:03:01.513
So if you could appeal to somebody’s heart

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:06.325
and put a bandhan on the heart you can
melt that person.

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:10.933
And if you love someone and if you want
that person should be corrected -

00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:13.549
supposing such a person is a drunkard,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.565
or a person who beats you and is torturing
you,

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.761
because he’s under the spell of some drugs
or some sort of a foreign thing -

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:28.802
then you just put bandhan to his heart
and you will see, they’ll be changing.

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:32.324
They’ll be changing very fast. And that’s
why you say “change of heart”.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.582
Everywhere you’ll find, in every scripture
it is written,

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.816
change of heart is needed, not the change
of clothes.

00:03:39.017 --> 00:03:43.152
So it’s not intellectual changing, but -
or rational changing,

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:49.708
but it is the change of heart, and that is
brought about by moving

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:56.152
the heart chakra on the right-hand side
in the clockwise manner -

00:03:56.353 --> 00:03:59.784
that is the heart itself, in the clockwise
manner.

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:03.722
If you can do that, you can really do
marvels.

00:04:03.923 --> 00:04:10.628
And that’s how, on a collective basis,
the heart is sort of the innermost,

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:19.362
innermost string of the collective; one
string that is passing through all of us.

00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.645
So if you could strike at the innermost -

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:26.620
because in a 3 and 1\2 circle that’s
the innermost point -

00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:30.019
if you touch there, it passes over this.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.550
Supposing you touch somewhere else
then it might break.

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:37.057
But at the beginning if you start striking
it, it goes

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:43.357
very nicely and passes into complete
circumference.

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:47.978
Now the center one I have told you is
the heart plexus,

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:52.721
which we call as cardiac plexus, and
it has got ten (twelve) sub-plexuses.

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.968
And the English names for that I will,

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.039
again I’m going to give you the complete
list. I don’t know when will I have time

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.265
to go through the medical journal, but
I’ll find out all of them.

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:05.461
And I’m going to tell you what they call it
in the medical terminology.

00:05:05.662 --> 00:05:09.851
But they know that there are ten (twelve)
sub-plexuses which are supplying

00:05:10.052 --> 00:05:14.197
to the muscles of the heart, to the lungs
and to the right-side lungs

00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:19.049
and that’s how they divide it. But they do
not know that it is already three parts

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.134
and then there are ten petals which
are working it out –

00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.760
I’m sorry, twelve petals that are working
it out.

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:30.416
So three divided into twelve is four each
side.

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:33.612
But actually it is not so.

00:05:33.813 --> 00:05:41.219
It is the twelve petals are together
in the center,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.538
and the center one is known as
the “sacred heart”.

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:56.941
In the Bible it is called as “sacred heart”
and this, the sacredness of that heart

00:05:57.142 --> 00:06:03.510
in the abstract form is the motherly love
of God.

00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:07.758
That’s why the Jagadamba, the Mother
of the Universe, resides in that place.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:15.281
And these, those twelve petals act
according to the Mother of the heart,

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:18.484
and that’s why we cannot allot them
to this side or that side,

00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:22.967
because it is She who actually makes them
pulsate.

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:28.765
So here She becomes the dominant person
and not the heart. There the Spirit rules.

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:33.187
So Spirit has rules by itself, and it is
ruled

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:40.621
with the help of the reflection of God
Almighty Himself.

00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:46.371
It is on its own, it is arbitrary. It sees,
it watches, it is the witness.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:50.481
It watches the play of these ten petals –
twelve petals here.

00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:56.474
But if it finds that there’s too much
of strain on the center one,

00:06:56.675 --> 00:07:02.826
it just switches off. And when it’s
switched off the whole thing stops.

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:08.896
You see? So you must understand the
difference between the other, other chakras

00:07:09.097 --> 00:07:14.466
and this one is, that there is the Spirit
on one side

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.295
and the Mother on the other side,
and on the other side

00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:24.527
is a human perfect personality. Three
things altogether.

00:07:24.728 --> 00:07:27.957
Now, if you reduce them to our three 
powers, you’d understand it.

00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:32.810
On one side is the instrument, or you
can say

00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:38.675
the nucleus for the left-hand side working.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:40.784
In the center it is,

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:44.591
or you can say the left-hand side working,
you can say the Mahakali’s working.

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:48.590
In the center, you can say, it is for
the Mahalakshmi working.

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:55.060
And the nucleus for the working
of the right-hand side

00:07:55.261 --> 00:07:59.864
is in the heart, on the right-hand side
where Rama resides.

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:05.020
Because we can call it a nucleus. The
reason is He was active, He was active

00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:09.661
without feeling, without feeling
the witness state.

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:16.925
Now they combined here where Krishna came
and He felt the witness state.

00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:19.948
And He called it as Leela, is the whole
play.

00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:23.965
Rama never called it as play, but He
called it as play.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:29.895
So that’s why Krishna here is completed
and that’s why we call Him a Sampurna,

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:34.510
is a complete incarnation, at here.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.472
(…) But now, this coming back to the heart
again.

00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:40.792
On the right-hand side we have got Rama’s
place.

00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:48.284
Now Rama was known for His obedience
to His father, if you know His story.

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:55.339
His father was in Ayodhya, he was ruling
there, and he had three wives.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:01.621
The third wife had no – I mean, she had
two sons,

00:09:01.822 --> 00:09:06.769
but she could not see Rama getting
the throne.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.550
She was a very nice mother, but somebody,
you see,

00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.508
some lady went and told something to her

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:15.245
and she listened to her and she told
her husband that,

00:09:15.446 --> 00:09:20.331
“If you want to give me my boon,
the promised boon,

00:09:20.532 --> 00:09:25.074
you have to make Rama go into the jungle
for fourteen years,

00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:30.539
and give the throne to my son Bharat.”

00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:39.448
And when Dashratha heard this, he fainted,
he fainted with this request.

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:42.004
But Rama was there, He heard it

00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:46.332
and He immediately told her that “I’m going
to the forest and I’ve accepted it.

00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:49.612
And you appoint your son as the Bharat,
for me, it’s alright.”

00:09:49.813 --> 00:09:54.005
And that’s how He went, you see. Just
to obey the order of His father,

00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:57.839
because father had not even ordered,
but because he was compelled.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.503
He had given his wife two boons,

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:04.019
that once you see, in a war she saved
his life, so he said that

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.933
“Whenever you want, you can ask 
for these two boons.”

00:10:07.134 --> 00:10:10.737
And they were, she never knew that she
would use them in such a funny way.

00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:14.770
Later on she repented, because Bharata
came and He refused to accept the throne

00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:19.152
and he put only Rama’s slippers there and
ruled there, and everything was different.

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:25.238
But Dashratha died, because when Rama
went away, he just died.

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:32.511
So you see, Rama’s life shows how
He was obedient

00:10:32.712 --> 00:10:36.353
to His parents. He suffered so much.

00:10:36.554 --> 00:10:41.044
Anyone who has not been respectful
to his parents…

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:49.544
You see, if your parents have been unkind,
you have every right

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:51.730
to tell them that they should not be unkind
to you

00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:58.481
and that you feel hurt, but you have
no business to answer them back

00:10:58.682 --> 00:11:01.966
and you have to be respectful, you have
to be respectful

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:06.605
because they represent your primordial
parents.

00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:11.801
You are not to shout at them and misbehave.
You have to be respectful to them.

00:11:12.002 --> 00:11:15.271
They may be bad people, but you have
to respect them,

00:11:15.472 --> 00:11:19.732
because you have chosen them. When you
were born, you chose them.

00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:23.847
You could not have been born to them,
you have really chosen them

00:11:24.048 --> 00:11:27.015
and you said, “These are going to be
my parents.”

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:31.927
So if they are your parents, they are there
because of certain reasons,

00:11:32.128 --> 00:11:33.610
because you have been seeking them

00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:37.201
in your previous lives and that’s how
you are there.

00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:41.279
(…) You’re not to boss over them,
it’s real, I’m telling you the secret.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.982
Is not for anything for you see, to make
you change your ways or anything,

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:48.505
but I’m just telling you the secret because
you have lost

00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:53.161
the idea of the secretive methods
of winning over people

00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:57.588
and understanding them and managing them,
and really you will have your way.

00:11:57.789 --> 00:12:01.038
Only thing is to respect them.
