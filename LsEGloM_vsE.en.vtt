WEBVTT

00:33.509 --> 00:50.140
We have arranged this Puja specially in England
so that many more can come and work out the

00:50.140 --> 00:54.630
awakening of Shri Krishna.

00:54.630 --> 01:14.440
Gita was written long time back, and it has
been translated into so many languages, and

01:14.440 --> 01:30.460
lots of commentaries and criticism has been
there.  So this bookish knowledge of Gita

01:30.460 --> 01:38.830
has ruined many people, and even today you
find there are many people who are selling

01:38.830 --> 01:47.360
the books of Gita all over and making it into
a bookish knowledge.  I don’t think Krishna

01:47.360 --> 01:55.860
ever thought that His knowledge will be sold
out like this to every Tom, Dick and Harry.

01:55.860 --> 02:03.810
As now, as you know, the Jehovah’s Witness,
they also selling Bible.  So it has become

02:03.810 --> 02:11.610
a marketing company for Shri Krishna’s Gita.

02:11.610 --> 02:23.320
There have been lots of horrible things against
the real religion of ascent, and Krishna has

02:23.320 --> 02:31.120
said, “Whenever there is the decline of
religion,” which is true today very much,

02:31.120 --> 02:44.879
“and whenever there is the saints being
tortured, I come on this earth to save the

02:44.879 --> 02:58.260
saints, and to destroy all the negative forces
and the devils,” as you call them, rakshasas.

02:58.260 --> 03:10.670
Pushtas they are called as, cruel people.
So awakening of Krishna is very important,

03:10.670 --> 03:22.659
that within us He should arise and He should
manifest His qualities within us.  Then only

03:22.659 --> 03:26.810
the forces will work out.

03:26.810 --> 03:36.999
Krishna, as a child, killed so many rakshasas.
Then He played with gopis just to open their

03:36.999 --> 03:51.769
Kundalini; He had the rasa by which to make
the energy of Shri Radha to pass through them.

03:51.769 --> 04:05.950
After killing Kamsa, the main rakshasa who
was ruling, who was actually His uncle, He

04:05.950 --> 04:12.539
killed him.  That means, your relations,
if they are devils and they are rakshasas,

04:12.539 --> 04:20.980
they have to be killed. Because he is your
relation you should not try to save him and

04:20.980 --> 04:31.660
try to bestow his evil on Sahaja Yogis or
on Sahaja Yoga.

04:31.660 --> 04:37.419
So Sahaja Yoga is the only organization in
the whole world, whether you call it spiritual

04:37.419 --> 04:45.419
or whatever you may call it, is the only organization
that it is also anxious to throw away many

04:45.419 --> 04:51.670
people from Sahaja Yoga.  There is no organization
- I mean we are not organization, also. But

04:51.670 --> 04:59.950
there is no spiritual movement, there is no
movement in the whole world that not only

04:59.950 --> 05:06.390
allows people to go out of Sahaja Yoga but
throws them out, because it is bound by the

05:06.390 --> 05:17.121
divine laws and it has to abide by the divine
laws.  Shri Krishna’s style was that: what

05:17.121 --> 05:26.000
is the need to throw them away? Just kill
them, finished.  So He killed His own uncle,

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
making His own aunt a widow.  His own uncle
He threw away, out of the world, sent him

05:34.000 --> 05:43.990
to hell directly, finished it off. But in
Sahaja Yoga we give a chance for such people

05:43.990 --> 05:54.640
also who are very devilish types, who are
very detrimental to our growth, who are against

05:54.640 --> 06:02.900
spirituality, who are against God, we give
them a long rope to hang themselves. That’s

06:02.900 --> 06:15.430
the Mother side of this incarnation, but the
Krishna side is a very fast-moving one.

06:15.430 --> 06:28.310
Krishna did not live for very long.  In that
short time, how many rakshasas He killed!

06:28.310 --> 06:36.430
He fought on the side of Pandavas and He killed
all the Kauravas.  He didn’t kill, He said,

06:36.430 --> 06:50.970
but He did.  So the style of Krishna on one
side also is extremely sweet, extremely nice.

06:50.970 --> 06:56.440
He is like honey, that’s why He is called
Madhava, Madhu.  He is like honey on one

06:56.440 --> 07:10.550
side, only to the bees, only to the people
who want to be blessed by Him. But to the

07:10.550 --> 07:19.870
evil people, I think He’s one of the most
dangerous personalities.  Of course Shiva

07:19.870 --> 07:37.650
also does that, He has killed so many rakshasas.
And also Devi has killed many rakshasas, but

07:37.650 --> 07:47.810
She went into wars, actual wars, and She went
into discussions and arguments and things

07:47.810 --> 07:59.520
like that; but Shri Krishna, He never argued
and He knew how to get rid of them, one by

07:59.520 --> 08:07.109
one, and He played some tricks on them.
One of them I’ll tell you.

08:07.109 --> 08:20.490
There was a rakshasa who by pleasing Shiva
had got a blessing

08:20.490 --> 08:32.970
that he
is sleeping and in his sleep anybody wakes

08:32.970 --> 08:44.020
him up, such a person should be made into
ashes, bhasmasak.  Must be a good sleeper,

08:44.020 --> 08:57.009
I tell you, our neighbor, the camper, gets
some sleep like that.  And he said, “I

08:57.009 --> 09:00.460
should not be disturbed if I am sleeping.”

09:00.460 --> 09:04.360
So Shiva thought, “It’s a very simple
thing, you see. Why should anybody disturb

09:04.360 --> 09:10.840
this old Johnny? And he would be sleeping
in some cave somewhere, so it’s all right.”

09:10.840 --> 09:19.980
He didn’t think it would be quite dangerous.

09:19.980 --> 09:33.960
And he had also blessings that nobody can
conquer him, and

09:33.960 --> 09:46.580
he cannot be, he cannot be disturbed by anybody
who tries to conquer this boon on him.  So

09:46.580 --> 09:52.630
actually he was a saint, in a way, because
he was meditating and all that, but some saints

09:52.630 --> 09:58.609
become ascetic and become really, like you
should say, very right-sided.  So I would

09:58.609 --> 10:04.059
call him a rakshasa only because this kind
of people are of no use.  They just go on

10:04.059 --> 10:10.190
cursing people, saying things to them and
just finishing them off.  So then you, of

10:10.190 --> 10:15.929
course in Sahaja Yoga language there are only
two things; there are Sahaja Yogis or rakshasas,

10:15.929 --> 10:21.910
there’s nothing in between.  So we could
find he was a very right-sided, horrible,

10:21.910 --> 10:25.869
ascetic fellow who got this boon from Shiva.

10:25.869 --> 10:32.119
There was one rakshasa, actual rakshasa, I
mean that was no saintliness in him at all.

10:32.119 --> 10:40.119
This is a mixture, half-baked sort of thing.
You see, if you see the canvas of Mahabharata

10:40.119 --> 10:50.089
you will be amazed that all kinds of peoples
are described in that.  So now, this second

10:50.089 --> 10:56.859
one was a real, real rakshasa, born out of
rakshasas and was of a rakshasa quality.

10:56.859 --> 11:09.499
He, too, had another boon from Shiva that
nobody can kill him. Unless and until somebody

11:09.499 --> 11:22.059
who has got Your boon that he can kill somebody,
nobody else should kill him.

11:22.059 --> 11:27.320
Imagine poor Shiva, you see, He thought, “It’s
a very sensible thing, after all, so that

11:27.320 --> 11:33.970
he won’t cross Me.” He said, “All right.”
He’s very easily pleased, Shiva is, the

11:33.970 --> 11:38.409
problem is that.

11:38.409 --> 11:50.729
So this second one, the real one, the real
rakshasa was torturing people, and he started

11:50.729 --> 11:58.089
a big war and Shri Krishna also went in for
that war.  He was the one, that’s the only

11:58.089 --> 12:07.159
war He fought Himself and they were all fighting
there.  So Shri Krishna knew that this Shiva

12:07.159 --> 12:15.419
is not going to let this person down at any
cost, because he knows, “I am all right,”

12:15.419 --> 12:22.099
so He would not allow him to be lost.  So
what should we do?

12:22.099 --> 12:26.739
So He played a trick. He started running out

12:26.739 --> 12:35.239
of the battlefield.  Now is regarded as something
very cowardly to run out of a battlefield,

12:35.239 --> 12:41.590
you see.  I mean a person, if like that goes
to his house, his wife will refuse to have

12:41.590 --> 12:48.960
him.  It’s a very cowardly thing and it’s
very disgraceful, but what is for God, it

12:48.960 --> 12:56.070
has, it has - They have no sense of grace
or disgrace, you see.  So He ran out of the

12:56.070 --> 13:04.349
battlefield which we call, that’s why He
is called as Ranchodas, it means “the one

13:04.349 --> 13:07.890
who runs away from the battlefield.” Ranchodas.
It is His name. One of the names of Shri Krishna,

13:07.890 --> 13:18.729
is Ranchodas.  So He ran out, He ran out
and when this rakshasa discovered that Krishna

13:18.729 --> 13:24.070
has run away, he ran after Him. But Krishna
was running very fast, you see.  Rakshasa,

13:24.070 --> 13:31.109
being so bulky, could not run that fast, but
still he was running, you see.  And Krishna

13:31.109 --> 13:38.839
was seeing that he sees Him running up to
that, was keeping it.  So He went there and

13:38.839 --> 13:44.900
He entered into the cave where this another
half-baked rakshasa and half-baked yogi was

13:44.900 --> 13:55.760
sleeping.  He took out His shawl, Shri Krishna,
and put it on that yogi and He hid Himself.

13:55.760 --> 14:03.700
He covered his face – he was fast asleep
so very gently He did it.

14:03.700 --> 14:15.099
Now came the number one rakshasa, he entered
into the cave, couldn’t see Krishna anywhere

14:15.099 --> 14:21.910
but he saw this man sleeping, He saw this
is Shri Krishna,  “Oh, so now You are tired

14:21.910 --> 14:27.369
and now You are sleeping, now I’ll see how
You can survive, I’ll see to it.”  And

14:27.369 --> 14:37.190
he just went onto his throat, so this half-baked
fellow who was granted this boon, got up and

14:37.190 --> 14:45.589
he looked at him and with his third eye he
burnt him and he became ….  This is the

14:45.589 --> 14:47.510
trick.

14:47.510 --> 15:02.170
So that is how He killed so many rakshasas,
and also He told tricks to others in arguments,

15:02.170 --> 15:14.349
also He killed half-baked people, quite a
lot of them.  So I must say He was so powerful

15:14.349 --> 15:26.890
that He could work out any trick on people,
sitting down in one place. And there are so

15:26.890 --> 15:37.249
many stories about Him which I cannot tell
in one lecture, that His killing process was

15:37.249 --> 15:43.440
so smooth that nobody objected to it.

15:43.440 --> 15:48.919
There was a woman who was a devil, was sent
by Kamsa to kill Him.  And she had poison,

15:48.919 --> 15:57.419
she had put poison in her breast and she came
and she started nursing Him, and when He started

15:57.419 --> 16:06.419
sucking her (when he was a little boy of three,
four years, or maybe two years) her breast,

16:06.419 --> 16:15.159
she started becoming big, big and she died.
And then they saw that she was Putana, the

16:15.159 --> 16:16.690
one who was the devil, known.

16:16.690 --> 16:28.909
And once He knew that there are two rakshasas
who are camouflaged as two big trees.  So

16:28.909 --> 16:36.899
His mother tied Him once with - she was angry
because He was stealing her butter so she

16:36.899 --> 16:47.589
didn’t know what to tie so she tied Him
with a pounding - that we have got for rice

16:47.589 --> 16:53.899
pounding, a kind of a wooden thing, big thing.
It’s quite heavy.  So she tied Him to that.

16:53.899 --> 17:00.540
It’s such a heavy thing, I mean, you need
at least five-six people to lift it, but when

17:00.540 --> 17:06.549
she went away, Shri Krishna just walked with
it with His small, little feet, you see, and

17:06.549 --> 17:09.749
went near those trees and hit them both on
both the sides and both the trees fell down

17:09.749 --> 17:12.869
and the rakshasas died.

17:12.869 --> 17:25.649
He was so knowledgeable and so clever, because
you know that He is the brain. He is the Virata.

17:25.649 --> 17:33.630
He did it without any compassion whatsoever.
All His love, all His compassion, all everything,

17:33.630 --> 17:43.410
duty, was only meant for His gopis and gopes.
And then, when He became the king, also His

17:43.410 --> 17:52.180
life is very mysterious for people to understand,
but Sahaja yogis can understand it. But when

17:52.180 --> 17:59.040
He became the king, He had to have wives,
so He married five wives.  Imagine, more

17:59.040 --> 18:07.410
than Mohammed Sahib.  These five, why five?
Because they were five elements.  So they

18:07.410 --> 18:13.990
were the causal of the five elements so He
married five wives.  Now he had sixteen thousand

18:13.990 --> 18:17.060
powers.

18:17.060 --> 18:23.210
Now you see a man, he may be old, even about
ninety years of age, if he wants to keep some

18:23.210 --> 18:30.280
women around him, they will say he is a bad
man.  Not with a Mother, no, Mother can have

18:30.280 --> 18:34.900
as many as She likes, nobody is going to say
anything about Her character, because Mother

18:34.900 --> 18:43.180
is Mother. But a man, see, he might be absolutely
jumping into his grave, whatever it is.

18:43.180 --> 18:48.590
And there also, in India especially, if a
lady tries to help him out, to be out of the

18:48.590 --> 18:53.350
grave, they will say he had bad relations
with her.

18:53.350 --> 18:59.270
So it was such a bad situation at that time
that He didn’t want to have bad name.

18:59.270 --> 19:04.270
So He said, “What should we do about these
powers, because they’ll be women?  If they

19:04.270 --> 19:09.380
have to come on this earth, they’ll be women
and I don’t want to have bad name,” because

19:09.380 --> 19:17.580
He came for dharma.  So what He did that
these women became the princesses, and one

19:17.580 --> 19:25.920
king captured all of them.  All these sixteen
thousand women were under the capture of this

19:25.920 --> 19:36.620
man and this man was about to abuse them,
so Shri Krishna invaded that man and got hold

19:36.620 --> 19:42.960
of all these.

19:42.960 --> 20:00.220
So

20:00.220 --> 20:17.790
the

20:17.790 --> 20:24.290
sixteen thousand women which were captured
by this camp - imagine why should it be sixteen

20:24.290 --> 20:30.210
thousand?  Imagine sixteen thousand women,
it’s no easy thing to do.  This man had

20:30.210 --> 20:37.630
sixteen thousand women who succumbed to his
aggression and were there.  And then He attacked

20:37.630 --> 20:44.510
this man and captured those sixteen thousand
women and brought them and legally married

20:44.510 --> 20:49.010
them to show they were married. But what’s
the question of marriage because they were

20:49.010 --> 20:58.280
His powers?  And He used their powers, you
see. For what? For creating so many things,

20:58.280 --> 21:06.700
like if Shri Krishna had not come we would
not have known really the significance of

21:06.700 --> 21:09.720
spiritual life.

21:09.720 --> 21:16.951
He was the first who talked of spiritual life.
Rama did not talk of spiritual life, though

21:16.951 --> 21:21.440
there was an undercurrent in India.  People
knew there is spiritual life because there

21:21.440 --> 21:31.290
were saints, there were lots of what you call
the seers.  All of them were talking about

21:31.290 --> 21:39.820
it. But no incarnation talked about spiritual
life.    We had Rama Avatara, then we had

21:39.820 --> 21:44.680
Parashurama.  We had so many of these people.
Never, never they talked of spiritual life,

21:44.680 --> 21:52.800
never.  It was Shri Krishna only who first
started talking about spiritual life, and

21:52.800 --> 21:58.050
only to Arjuna He talked, because you see
what was the condition.  People were not

21:58.050 --> 22:03.370
prepared.  So those people, Sahaja Yogis,
who feel frustrated today because there are

22:03.370 --> 22:08.240
not many Sahaja Yogis or there is an obstruction,
there are certain problems, must know that

22:08.240 --> 22:15.210
at the time of Shri Krishna He could dare
speak about spirituality only to one person

22:15.210 --> 22:24.940
and that one was Arjuna.  So, I mean, we
are much better off, you see, aren’t we?

22:24.940 --> 22:33.030
Then, of course, of course after Shri Krishna,
who took the lead was Christ and He started

22:33.030 --> 22:41.510
talking about spirituality.  Even you’ll
be surprised that Abraham or Moses did not

22:41.510 --> 22:51.800
talk of spirituality.  They talked of God,
but not of spirituality. Till Christ came,

22:51.800 --> 22:57.240
nobody said that you are to be born again,
even on the other side of the world, only

22:57.240 --> 23:06.950
Shri Krishna said this thing.  Shri Rama
was taught by His guru that He should be born

23:06.950 --> 23:13.100
again, in the sense that what is the Kundalini
and all that, not that He should be born again.

23:13.100 --> 23:19.511
But He had become a human being, as I told
you. So he taught Him about Kundalini, he

23:19.511 --> 23:25.960
told Him about Kundalini but it was a very
secret science followed by only very nath

23:25.960 --> 23:33.220
pundits as we call them, as the Adi Nath and
all that.  Very few people were given Realization.

23:33.220 --> 23:40.010
In Rama’s time as we know of one, Nachiketa,
and His father-in-law was a realized soul,

23:40.010 --> 23:45.980
so compared to that, imagine how many of
us are today here who know about spirituality.

23:45.980 --> 23:52.910
Not only we feel our spirituality, we are
spiritual.  If you apply law of chance, I

23:52.910 --> 24:02.110
don’t think there could have been after
Christ even thirty people available, because

24:02.110 --> 24:09.300
if you see Christ died only two thousand years
back.  From Krishna’s time to Christ’s

24:09.300 --> 24:19.420
time it was six thousand years, and in six
thousand years Krishna had none and Christ

24:19.420 --> 24:30.320
had twelve, so now calculate only two thousand
years after that, how many could be?

24:30.320 --> 24:40.000
So we must know that it’s now in a new explosion,
that’s why I call it as “blossom time,”

24:40.000 --> 24:46.560
that we are definitely spiritual people, we
have got spirituality and that the Divine

24:46.560 --> 24:52.380
is working. So the Kali Yuga is finishing,
now it is Krita Yuga and the Krita Yuga is

24:52.380 --> 25:01.390
acting and this acting of Krita Yuga is responsible
for giving us so many Sahaja Yogis.  Krita

25:01.390 --> 25:09.460
Yuga means in the time when this all-pervading
Power has started acting.  Nobody before

25:09.460 --> 25:20.980
felt the cool vibrations, can you believe
that?  They felt the cool but not the vibrations.

25:20.980 --> 25:30.630
It was never related to any science; it was
never related to physical science specially.

25:30.630 --> 25:41.010
So I must say the achievement of Sahaja Yoga
is tremendous.   Also, thanks to this evolution

25:41.010 --> 25:56.960
in the acting of Yugas, also, that the all-pervading
Power has started acting as I am on this earth.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.310
But you could say that “Mother, why didn’t
You come earlier?”   That was not the

26:00.310 --> 26:07.160
time.  Even today you find stupid people
all around us.  I mean the percentage of

26:07.160 --> 26:14.860
sensible people seems to be quite low in the
western countries, though high up in others,

26:14.860 --> 26:19.690
but in the western countries very low, as
far as the wisdom is concerned.

26:19.690 --> 26:23.080
So we have these obstructions, these small
things going on, doesn’t matter.  Sahaja

26:23.080 --> 26:31.980
Yoga will now prosper.  It will flower and
whatever people may say, you shouldn’t worry,

26:31.980 --> 26:40.520
because once they start finding joy and happiness,
once they start finding the truth, and if

26:40.520 --> 26:45.130
they are honest, they will not leave Sahaja
Yoga. And many people know that they just

26:45.130 --> 26:49.400
don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.  I mean,
say there is a husband and wife, and the wife

26:49.400 --> 26:53.740
is a horrible woman, supposing, or the husband
is a horrible person and he obstructs the

26:53.740 --> 26:59.490
wife from coming to Sahaja Yoga, the husband
will say, “All right, you go ahead, I will

26:59.490 --> 27:05.430
be with Sahaja Yoga because I have now felt
the ambrosia, I have felt the beauty, the

27:05.430 --> 27:08.380
joy.”

27:08.380 --> 27:15.920
Now imagine at the time of Shri Krishna, He
talked to one person about the spirituality,

27:15.920 --> 27:25.450
only one person, Arjuna, which was heard by
Sanjaya and which he related.  It is so written

27:25.450 --> 27:34.820
by Vyasa, but He didn’t tell to everyone,
didn’t show to anyone.  He appeared in

27:34.820 --> 27:44.320
His Virata form on the battlefield but He
never showed, but now you have got photographs

27:44.320 --> 27:50.310
to see, even if you can’t see with your
eyes.  Some can see some things also, I’ve

27:50.310 --> 27:55.650
seen that some are feeling it. So you are
developing, you are growing into it.   So

27:55.650 --> 28:02.340
this is into a new realm.  It was Shri Krishna
Who started talking about it.  Of course

28:02.340 --> 28:07.080
these nath pundits did believe in all that
spirituality, but they did not talk about

28:07.080 --> 28:15.630
it, till the time, I think, of Gyaneshwara,
perhaps would be.  It was first the Gyaneshwara

28:15.630 --> 28:21.470
only who started talking about it.  Before
that it was a secret kept.  Of course after

28:21.470 --> 28:29.980
Gyaneshwara we had other people talking about
it, like we had Mohammed Sahib, we had Nanaka,

28:29.980 --> 28:37.930
we had so many other people like Shirdi Sai
Nath and some Sufi people and they started

28:37.930 --> 28:43.080
talking on spirituality.

28:43.080 --> 28:52.900
So we have to be historically very much thankful
to Krishna because He is the One who has broken

28:52.900 --> 28:57.700
the first knot and that’s why it’s called
as Vishnu Granthi and the Vishnu Granthi to

28:57.700 --> 29:08.590
knowledge has been first opened by Shri Krishna
and He wanted that gradually it should work,

29:08.590 --> 29:20.650
gradually.  So His Gita is not so clear cut,
but is diplomatically written.  So now we

29:20.650 --> 29:28.120
can find that the only person who first tried
his hand on Gita was Gyanadeva and Gyanadeva,

29:28.120 --> 29:33.520
when he wrote on the sixth chapter, everything
about Kundalini, they just said, “This is

29:33.520 --> 29:42.481
banned, you are not to read this one,” because
they could not deliver the goods.  People

29:42.481 --> 29:48.500
knew about Kundalini, but they didn’t want
to read because they were told, “No, No,

29:48.500 --> 29:53.940
don’t read, this is very wrong,” and all
that.

29:53.940 --> 30:02.910
So spirituality is a subject absolutely unknown
to the western people, though Christ was there

30:02.910 --> 30:11.510
but they have been only crucifying Him.
If I see the Christianity, if I see Christ,

30:11.510 --> 30:18.460
it’s so organized.  From Christianity nobody
can get out.  Whatever sin you may commit,

30:18.460 --> 30:26.430
you are still a Christian.  I know there
was a fellow who murdered someone and he was

30:26.430 --> 30:27.430
taken to the courts.

30:27.430 --> 30:29.100
They said, “What are you?”

30:29.100 --> 30:32.170
And he said, “I am a Christian,” though
he had murdered.

30:32.170 --> 30:35.931
Then they gave him the Bible, “All right,
put your hand on the Bible and say you are

30:35.931 --> 30:39.450
a Christian.”

30:39.450 --> 30:44.660
He said, “I am a Christian, I believe in
Bible.” But why didn’t they ask, “Why

30:44.660 --> 30:50.030
did you kill then?”  Thou shalt not kill.

30:50.030 --> 30:56.650
So even these religions which were formed
did not have any rules or regulations that

30:56.650 --> 31:03.100
“All right, if somebody does like that we’ll
throw him out of our congregation or he is

31:03.100 --> 31:09.520
no more a Christian.”  On the contrary,
you’ll be surprised that when My father

31:09.520 --> 31:20.600
joined Congress in India to fight against
the British, they threw him out of the congregation

31:20.600 --> 31:26.300
because according to the missionaries there,
Christ was born in England.  He must be

31:26.300 --> 31:34.500
an Englishman, so how dare My father join
the Congress?  Such an absurd idea!

31:34.500 --> 31:42.030
So all these ideas which are so absurd, against
God - against religion, against spirituality

31:42.030 --> 31:50.730
- became very prevalent and useful and convenient
for these organized religions.  That’s

31:50.730 --> 31:57.180
one thing good about Hindu religion is there
is nothing like a organization.  So they

31:57.180 --> 32:03.440
can be agnostic, atheist, they can be anything.
They could be Buddhist, they could be Jains.

32:03.440 --> 32:09.800
They could be anything and they could be Christians,
but they could be Hindus also because it’s

32:09.800 --> 32:15.541
not organized and because they are not organized,
there is no restriction on them that “Don’t

32:15.541 --> 32:20.690
do like this; don’t do like that.”  But
despite that I have seen, I’m surprised

32:20.690 --> 32:25.891
that Hindus are very meek people because the
responsibility is left to themselves, not

32:25.891 --> 32:31.200
on an organization.   If you have murdered
somebody you are not to confess to the priest

32:31.200 --> 32:38.000
but confess to yourself and face yourself
all the time. But so many filthy things crawled

32:38.000 --> 32:48.020
into this religion, also, of caste system
which is just against Shri Krishna.  They

32:48.020 --> 32:53.400
have no business to take Shri Krishna’s
name and do all these nonsensical things because

32:53.400 --> 33:01.440
Shri Krishna Himself has said that, “In
everybody it resides.” But they changed

33:01.440 --> 33:05.930
it a little, saying that, “Your caste is
according to your birth.”  How can it be?

33:05.930 --> 33:07.730
 As I told you the other day.

33:07.730 --> 33:22.490
Now this is another story I would say that
they have tried to, Christ look like something

33:22.490 --> 33:27.560
very ordinary or even Shri Krishna look like
something ordinary.  These are the intellectuals.

33:27.560 --> 33:33.510
So on one side we have the stupid followers
and the another side we have those stupid

33:33.510 --> 33:45.440
intellectuals.  So the message of Krishna
never reached Hindus because He said, “In

33:45.440 --> 33:51.120
everybody resides the Spirit and you are part
and parcel of the whole.”   Now a cell

33:51.120 --> 34:02.550
in the hand, is it an outcast because it is
not in the brain?  So what a wrong thing

34:02.550 --> 34:11.570
they have done to Shri Krishna and that’s
why when they suffer from racialism, I say,

34:11.570 --> 34:18.720
“You did the same to the caste, through
your caste system you tortured the Harigans,

34:18.720 --> 34:29.180
you tortured the lower caste of people.
So now you have them.”  It boomerangs,

34:29.180 --> 34:31.129
whole thing.

34:31.129 --> 34:39.369
So Shri Krishna’s life, if you see, is the
beauty of it is that He said that “Life

34:39.369 --> 34:50.710
is a leela” - for Him, not for everyone,
because He is so powerful. And this leela

34:50.710 --> 34:57.599
part was taken over by Americans very nicely
because they were born in the land of Shri

34:57.599 --> 35:02.490
Krishna, that it’s all leela. “What’s
wrong? Do what you like, what’s wrong?”

35:02.490 --> 35:08.050
Whatever you are doing is just a leela, is
just a play. So what?   Marry as many as

35:08.050 --> 35:13.540
you like, leave your children to dogs, do
all kinds of things with your morality, destroy

35:13.540 --> 35:20.500
yourself morning till evening, behave in the
same manner as if they are animals. So what?

35:20.500 --> 35:24.231
Study the animal behavior because it’s as
if we have no sense of behavior, so we study

35:24.231 --> 35:28.339
the animal behavior and behave like the animals.

35:28.339 --> 35:35.190
So are we going to become now snakes or some
sort of worms or I don’t know what they

35:35.190 --> 35:47.980
are up to, and whole system is just the opposite
of Shri Krishna.  So this stupid movement

35:47.980 --> 35:54.760
of Shri Krishna’s consciousness reached
there.  I don’t know how they understood

35:54.760 --> 36:00.610
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America,
but somehow some bhoot must have told them

36:00.610 --> 36:07.870
that “You go there.”  And they are another
stupid people who are selling Gita, selling

36:07.870 --> 36:18.510
this bookish knowledge, but now of course
it has boomeranged on him and now they are

36:18.510 --> 36:28.839
all right.  Now they are frozen. But the
way they have been talking about Shri Krishna,

36:28.839 --> 36:34.640
they do not realize they have missed the point.
He said, “It’s a leela.” So then why

36:34.640 --> 36:39.540
are you wearing these dresses, why have you
become a sanyasi?  Why are you giving up

36:39.540 --> 36:48.710
- not to eat this food, not to eat that food?
And then they are taking drugs, they are selling

36:48.710 --> 36:49.710
drugs.

36:49.710 --> 36:57.980
Whatever is not based on truth will go to
something that is destructive.  Truth is

36:57.980 --> 37:04.820
the only thing that is constructive.  All
these ideas sometimes confuse us, what is

37:04.820 --> 37:09.730
this, in the name of God, in the name of Shri
Krishna, in the name of Christ, in the name

37:09.730 --> 37:18.620
of Mohammed Sahib all these things are done
and also some people do it even in My name,

37:18.620 --> 37:25.570
“Mother said; Mother said so.”  It is
prohibited for Sahaja yogi to say that because

37:25.570 --> 37:33.150
I’ve had enough of it in last lives.
So this life nobody is going to say, “Mother

37:33.150 --> 37:36.050
said it.”

37:36.050 --> 37:45.400
“I say.” Have that much confidence and
responsibility to say, “I say.”   I

37:45.400 --> 37:51.240
am a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, why
can’t you say?

37:51.240 --> 38:00.770
So now from today’s Puja onward we have
awakened the Shri Krishna within us, so His

38:00.770 --> 38:08.181
powers of sweetness as well of destruction
will act and you don’t have to worry, you

38:08.181 --> 38:11.870
are completely protected.  He has already
said that “Yoga dakshemo myam.”  “I

38:11.870 --> 38:19.220
give you yoga” and the “dakshemo myam”
means your benevolence, He looks after.

38:19.220 --> 38:30.940
So you don’t have to worry, but it will
act and it will work and nobody can harm you.

38:30.940 --> 38:40.660
It will all boomerang on them.  There’s
like divine punishment and you don’t have

38:40.660 --> 38:47.800
to worry.  Of course, as a Mother, I never
feel of punishing anyone, as such, but they

38:47.800 --> 38:54.750
just get punished, what can I do?  And now
this awakening can be very dangerous, so I

38:54.750 --> 39:02.890
think we have to accept it now within ourselves
that we have to be extremely sweet, nice,

39:02.890 --> 39:03.890
collective.

39:03.890 --> 39:09.470
If you are not collective then Krishna will
be after your life.  If you try to destroy

39:09.470 --> 39:13.680
collectivity He will be after you, I mean
He is a tremendous person, I tell you.  He

39:13.680 --> 39:20.100
is so tricky, He is so clever, and He is a
very smooth worker, I tell you.  So be careful.

39:20.100 --> 39:26.350
If you are collective then He’ll strengthen
you, He’ll nourish you, He’ll do everything,

39:26.350 --> 39:34.130
He’ll give you butter to eat.  So you have
to be collective, that’s the main part.

39:34.130 --> 39:39.030
And those people who just come to the program
and then disappear should know that it won’t

39:39.030 --> 39:44.410
work out.  You have to be collective and
if they don’t want to be collective, we

39:44.410 --> 39:49.530
don’t want to force them. But if they are
not collective they are not Sahaja Yogis and

39:49.530 --> 39:55.690
nobody should recommend them to anyone and
Sahaja Yogis should have nothing to do with

39:55.690 --> 40:04.900
non-collective people nor with people who
are not Sahaja Yogis.

40:04.900 --> 40:08.990
We have very beautiful children here, we have
beautiful families.   We have everything

40:08.990 --> 40:15.220
so beautiful, such beautiful people to love
each other and enjoy each other.  So we should

40:15.220 --> 40:21.830
not get entangled into the mess of other people
who are blind.  It would be like we have

40:21.830 --> 40:26.700
a nice organized place where everybody is
sitting in the light, suddenly you want to

40:26.700 --> 40:34.360
go to the place where there are many snakes
inhabited who are biting everyone.  So go

40:34.360 --> 40:39.480
ahead and then you shouldn’t say that “Mother,
you punished me.”   You wanted to go into

40:39.480 --> 40:47.220
the hell of the snakes, so you go and have
it.  I never punish. But maybe Shri Krishna

40:47.220 --> 40:56.520
might lure you there, you see that’s His
style, just to have a little bite of a snake.

40:56.520 --> 41:02.630
So according to Shri Krishna, we have to be
very playful.  Now we are all realized people,

41:02.630 --> 41:08.750
and you are very happy and you are all very
playful and joyous and also now you are so

41:08.750 --> 41:16.040
capable, you have spirituality, you can give
Realization to others.  Even I was told that

41:16.040 --> 41:24.230
in the streets people ask for Realization,
some people went to Eastern Blocs and they

41:24.230 --> 41:31.681
got five thousand people.  Somebody went
down to Argentina, got so many people.  So

41:31.681 --> 41:36.950
it’s very good, all these, My hands are
extending and the work is taking place.

41:36.950 --> 41:38.500
Everybody should take it up.

41:38.500 --> 41:42.270
Select a place and I’ll go there and work
it out.  Select one place and work it out,

41:42.270 --> 41:48.049
all of you can do it because you have now
got the powers, better work it out, use them.

41:48.049 --> 41:52.839
If you don’t use the powers, you’ll become
blunt, so use your powers and believe that

41:52.839 --> 41:58.550
you have power and that only thing you have
to keep in the bounds, in the maryadas of

41:58.550 --> 42:08.530
Sahaja Yoga, that you have to lead a very
moral, good life and you must feel your vibrations

42:08.530 --> 42:17.260
properly and keep good health which you can
easily do.  If, as they say, I can work like

42:17.260 --> 42:21.940
this, days in, day out, you can also work.
You are all very young, everybody seems to

42:21.940 --> 42:29.820
be younger than Me.  I am the oldest person
here.   So if I could do so much, why can’t

42:29.820 --> 42:30.820
you?

42:30.820 --> 42:34.880
So one thing you must ask in your prayer in
the evening when you are sleeping: “What

42:34.880 --> 42:41.070
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?” One sentence,
all of you, just ask this question: “What

42:41.070 --> 42:53.410
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”   Like persons
like Me or Shri Krishna or anyone, We don’t

42:53.410 --> 42:58.100
even feel We are doing anything.  So what
can We ask?   If I want to ask Myself, I’ll

42:58.100 --> 43:02.860
fall into an ocean I think, I don’t know,
I’ll be lost.  If I want to analyze Myself, I

43:02.860 --> 43:07.830
get lost.  If I want to think about Myself,
I get lost.  It’s beyond Me, then let it

43:07.830 --> 43:16.950
be, doesn’t matter.  I don’t want to
know Myself. But you better know yourself.

43:16.950 --> 43:19.100
You can’t be Me.

43:19.100 --> 43:27.870
So as far as I am concerned I only think that
as long as I live - I don’t know, I may

43:27.870 --> 43:33.420
live forever, I am living forever maybe, you
might say that, but whatever it is as long

43:33.420 --> 43:54.730
as I’m on this earth I will see that Sahaja
Yoga is fully established.  This is My promise

43:54.730 --> 43:55.740
to you.

43:55.740 --> 43:56.740
[Maharathi]

43:56.740 --> 44:03.100
He comes on this earth again to establish
the religion, but not only religion but Vishwa

44:03.100 --> 44:09.370
Nirmala Dharma, which is a much higher religion
than the ordinary religion of human beings.

44:09.370 --> 44:10.370
within themselves, is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma
we’ll establish in a very short time, I’m

44:10.370 --> 44:11.370
sure, on this earth.

44:11.370 --> 44:12.370
So may God bless you!

44:12.370 --> 44:13.370
So today the children are sleeping now – if
they can get up for a while they can come

44:13.370 --> 44:14.370
and wash My feet.  How many are awake?
Some are awake.  You can sing some Ganesha

44:14.370 --> 44:15.370
song instead of Atharva Sheersha.
(break in recording)

44:15.370 --> 44:16.370
…. no provision for this kind of acceptance
of these ornaments, but when he came he just

44:16.370 --> 44:17.370
tried to take everything that was in that
temple.  At that time the story was created,

44:17.370 --> 44:18.370
I don’t know how far it is true, but a story
of Indians, you see, Indian style.  The story

44:18.370 --> 44:19.370
was like this: that when Mahadeva was attacked
by him, He started running away from the temple.

44:19.370 --> 44:20.370
He was running, running, running, running
fast and then He found Bhairava sitting there.

44:20.370 --> 44:21.370
So Bhairava and Hanumana both were sitting
and They said, “You are the Devas of Devas,

44:21.370 --> 44:22.370
You are the Mahadeva of Devas and why are
You running?  After all, what is he, this

44:22.370 --> 44:23.370
Tamolang?  Why running? He was lame with
one foot and why are you running away from

44:23.370 --> 44:24.370
him? You can just finish him off; what is
the need to run away?”

44:24.370 --> 44:25.370
No, he was Mohammed Gazni. Sorry, he was Mohammed
Gazni who did it, but  Tamolanga also attacked

44:25.370 --> 44:26.370
but then Mohammed Gazni. So this Mohammed
Gazni was running after Mahadeva, and first Tamolanga

44:26.370 --> 44:27.370
has looted but he couldn’t go to that far,
so this Mohammed Gazni came in and he started

44:27.370 --> 44:28.370
looting that temple.  So then when he started
running after Mahadeva, Mahadeva told him,

44:28.370 --> 44:29.370
“You don’t know, you don’t know this
Mohammed Gazni, who is. His name is Mohammed

44:29.370 --> 44:30.370
Gazni but he is somebody else.”

44:30.370 --> 44:31.370
Said, “Who is he?”

44:31.370 --> 44:32.370
“All right, come, you hide here, I’ll
show you.”

44:32.370 --> 44:33.370
So behind Mahadeva was running Mohammed Gazni,
so they hid themselves on one side and they

44:33.370 --> 44:34.370
saw this Mohammed Gazni came and he was very
tired.  He sat down near one tree and he

44:34.370 --> 44:35.370
started just relaxing, and suddenly they found
it was Shri Krishna.  He said, “This valundar,”

44:35.370 --> 44:36.370
means this, this cunning fellow, “is running
after me, now do you think I may escape him?

44:36.370 --> 44:37.370
Of course I should have punished these Brahmins
who were misbehaving.  I did not so, he has

44:37.370 --> 44:38.370
come, but now I cannot help so I am away out
of it, you see, because this one has come

44:38.370 --> 44:39.370
after My life and now you cannot save yourself.”

44:39.370 --> 44:40.370
So this is the story the people, the general
public, created there.  So it has happened

44:40.370 --> 44:41.370
many a times because He was the brother of
the Shakti of Shiva and because He’s so

44:41.370 --> 44:42.370
clever, he’s so intelligent that Shiva was
quite afraid of Him, and overactive.   So

44:42.370 --> 44:43.370
you see Americans are extremely active people
and now, of course, England, we need not say.

44:43.370 --> 44:44.370
It’s a little lethargic, little bit, not
much.  So now the awakening of Shri Krishna

44:44.370 --> 44:45.370
is going to work everywhere, and you are all
going to be extremely active about Sahaja

44:45.370 --> 44:46.370
Yoga, I think so.  This is a new thing that
has happened, and I’m very happy it has

44:46.370 --> 44:47.370
happened and that the Americans also agreed
to come here.  By this we take a little bit

44:47.370 --> 44:48.370
of the qualities of Shiva to America, that
is of magnanimity and also of laziness a little

44:48.370 --> 44:49.370
bit, and give some qualities of Shri Krishna
to this country.  This exchanges it.

44:49.370 --> 44:50.370
Shri Krishna Puja 1990: Shri Mataji speaks
about the music to be played by the musicians.

44:50.370 --> 44:51.370
Below is a transcription of the relevant details.

44:51.370 --> 44:52.370
Now the last raga is Bhairavi has to be played
under all traditional ways and is a raga that

44:52.370 --> 44:53.370
is in praise of the power of the Spirit, because
it has such beautiful notes and notes which

44:53.370 --> 44:54.370
are … it’s a complete sampurna, is a complete
raga. All the twelve notes are in it. So you

44:54.370 --> 44:55.370
see it is such a complete raga and it has
to be played in all due respect to it. It’s

44:55.370 --> 44:56.370
a ragini, regarded as.

44:56.370 --> 44:57.370
Now as you know that the Heart Chakra has
got twelve petals, and the Durga resides on

44:57.370 --> 44:58.370
the Heart Chakra. Now the Durga’s qualities
are that She is protective of Her children,

44:58.370 --> 44:59.370
She’s very gentle, very soft with Her children,
and She’s extremely horrifying to the satanic

44:59.370 --> 45:00.370
people, to the negative people. So in this
raga I think because there are, the notes

45:00.370 --> 45:01.370
are spaced out. So either you could play it
slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in

45:01.370 --> 45:02.370
between. That’s why it is on a Durga’s
style. You see, either She is extremely gentle

45:02.370 --> 45:03.370
or She is extremely horrifying. So because
She has a double function: is one to look

45:03.370 --> 45:04.370
after Her children, and another is protect
Her children from the devils. So She has to

45:04.370 --> 45:05.370
be very quick about it, to fight them, and
to, in every way to frighten them and to be

45:05.370 --> 45:06.370
alert about it.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.370
So in the second part you all became very
alerted I saw. In the first part you were

45:07.370 --> 45:08.370
having a lullaby because it was the Mother’s
love that was playing. The second part you

45:08.370 --> 45:09.370
became alert, because She has to fight. Now,
this is such a nice raga because it gives

45:09.370 --> 45:10.370
you a better sense of security within yourself,
builds up sense of security, and also as you

45:10.370 --> 45:11.370
know medically that it’s important to build
up this chakra because that gives you antibodies

45:11.370 --> 45:12.370
created. So to fight all the diseases, to
fight all the foreign things which try to

45:12.370 --> 45:13.370
attack us.

45:13.370 --> 45:14.370
So this raga is so apt, absolutely apt for
today’s atmosphere and for today’s need.

45:14.370 --> 45:15.370
That we have to have the security of the Mother
and the protection of the Mother and that

45:15.370 --> 45:16.370
all the evil forces must be finished from
this world, and that’s how this raga has

45:16.370 --> 45:17.370
a very great significance and I thank him
very much for playing this raga.

45:17.370 --> 45:18.370
This is, now the last five minutes he would
like to play is the Bhairavi which is a complete

45:18.370 --> 45:19.370
raga as you can call it, is the complete purnima.
All the notes are there. And it is played

45:19.370 --> 45:20.370
in various ways and various styles and is
used for so many expressions of your feelings

45:20.370 --> 45:21.370
and thing. But in this also there’s a beautiful
song as you know, the Anhi Bhavani, is the

45:21.370 --> 45:22.370
one which is a song about the Mother Goddess.
And in this Anhi Bhavani, I think there is

45:22.370 --> 45:23.370
a little mixture in the … I don’t know
if it is absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

45:23.370 --> 45:24.370
Shri Mataji asks musicians: It is to be played
absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi?

45:24.370 --> 45:25.370
(Shri Mataji and musicians discuss together
a little then She asserts ... )

45:25.370 --> 45:26.370
It should be played in pure Bhairavi – this
is the best way. Because Bhairavi is the name

45:26.370 --> 45:27.370
of the Goddess.

45:27.370 --> 45:28.370
You see the purity of it creates that feeling
and that, I mean, it awakens that deity so

45:28.370 --> 45:29.370
that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

45:29.370 --> 45:30.370
(Shri Mataji and musicians talk together then
She continues ... )

45:30.370 --> 45:31.370
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, such
a lot of freedom. You can do what you like

45:31.370 --> 45:32.370
with it. But only thing is you have to keep
to the ragas and you have to keep to the Swaras

45:32.370 --> 45:33.370
and everything. You cannot just go crazy from
one to another like that. So it is like a

45:33.370 --> 45:34.370
big aeroplane which is going in the air with
everything completely fixed properly. You

45:34.370 --> 45:35.370
see, so it can go anywhere. Unless and until
it’s fixed, has it’s own maryadas it cannot

45:35.370 --> 45:36.370
go. So that has to be there. So first the
ragas are built, and built in such a way they

45:36.370 --> 45:37.370
are absolutely perfect and then you can go
wherever you feel like. Nothing will happen.

45:37.370 --> 45:38.370
(More discussion with musicians.)

45:38.370 --> 45:39.370
(Raga begins. Shri Mataji continues ...)

45:39.370 --> 45:40.370
First, he will play all the twelve notes which
are built in Bhairavi and then you will see

45:40.370 --> 45:41.370
how he keeps to that. He keeps to that

45:41.370 --> 45:42.370
Wow, wow! It’s the Heart Chakra. It’s
the Heart Chakra of Shiva.

45:42.370 --> 45:43.370
(Musicians continue to play.)

45:43.370 --> 45:44.370
The surrendering, you see. Islam is surrender.
Islam is the surrender.

45:44.370 --> 45:45.370
(Musicians continue to play.)

45:45.370 --> 45:46.370
Musician: In India it used to be different
about thirty or forty years ago, this is the

45:46.370 --> 45:47.370
kind of music we used to have, when people
would sit like you are, here, so nice, so

45:47.370 --> 45:48.370
beautiful, a family.

45:48.370 --> 45:49.370
Shri Mataji: Absolutely a family rapport.

45:49.370 --> 45:50.370
Musician: Absolutely

45:50.370 --> 45:51.370
Musician: You bring out that from us.

45:51.370 --> 45:52.370
Shri Mataji: You see what he’s saying is
this. You know I am such an old woman of sixty-seven

45:52.370 --> 45:53.370
years and I think of My childhood and also
of My family. My father was a great, great

45:53.370 --> 45:54.370
connoisseur of music and he supported music,
and musicians left and right, and we heard

45:54.370 --> 45:55.370
all the musicians because they would come
to our house, stay with us and he would go

45:55.370 --> 45:56.370
all out to spend for them, pay for them; I
mean, do all kinds of things. So in the family

45:56.370 --> 45:57.370
the music came in and then My sister took
to music and everybody in family took to music

45:57.370 --> 45:58.370
quite a lot because of My father because he
was fond of cricket and also of music very

45:58.370 --> 45:59.370
much. But the best part of it, what I am feeling,
all the family would sit down and then My

45:59.370 --> 46:00.370
sister would sing or anybody, you see the
rapport. Then he would give the, what you

46:00.370 --> 46:01.370
call, the impetus, he would give us the feelings
of: “Now, this is it now coming up.”

46:01.370 --> 46:02.370
There’s such a rapport in the whole thing
between the musician and all, and with such

46:02.370 --> 46:03.370
relaxation everybody appreciating it and just
like waves after waves of a big ocean coming

46:03.370 --> 46:04.370
over and that sort of a thing it was. And
then only you can enjoy music. But if you

46:04.370 --> 46:05.370
are worried about time, this, that… we give
up all that to listen to music. And even if

46:05.370 --> 46:06.370
you carry all that load with you, what’s
the use of listening to music? You have to

46:06.370 --> 46:07.370
come to music with all these things left out
and then you really enjoy the whole thing.

46:07.370 --> 46:08.370
And that is what today I feel that our whole
family of Sahaja Yogis are enjoying this rapport

46:08.370 --> 46:09.370
with him and enjoying the whole beauty of
the whole music, it’s something so great.

46:09.370 --> 46:10.370
But see the surrendering, you just develop
the feeling what you get out of it, you see

46:10.370 --> 46:11.370
like….

46:11.370 --> 46:11.372
(Music continues.)
