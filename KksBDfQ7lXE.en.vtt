00:01.830 --> 00:05.230
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

00:06.110 --> 00:14.750
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in totality

00:16.590 --> 00:19.670
is a reflection of Adi Shakti in totality;

00:20.310 --> 00:24.990
or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,

00:25.350 --> 00:28.230
She's managing all these three powers.

00:28.510 --> 00:32.790
But Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali

00:32.990 --> 00:38.990
in the sense that it is the desire of God Almighty.

00:40.950 --> 00:46.990
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all the three powers

00:47.790 --> 00:56.630
and that's why we can say that when She is in a potential stage

00:56.830 --> 01:04.590
She is Mahakali and then She divides Herself into two other forces

01:05.030 --> 01:07.750
as Mahasaraswati

01:08.070 --> 01:17.510
and the ascending force that we call,

01:17.790 --> 01:20.910
or as a parasympathetic nervous system

01:21.470 --> 01:23.950
expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi force.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.910
So She has actually all these forces in Herself,

01:28.110 --> 01:33.710
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,

01:34.910 --> 01:38.350
She desires to act and when She wants to act

01:38.550 --> 01:42.670
Her potential force becomes these two other forces.

01:45.110 --> 01:49.230
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must understand

01:49.550 --> 01:55.630
that inbuilt within this force within us is desire;

01:57.750 --> 02:02.870
so we can desire anything, if we want we can desire everything,

02:03.230 --> 02:10.990
we can desire say the joy, we can desire the knowledge,

02:11.550 --> 02:15.270
we can desire to be compassionate and love and we can desire also

02:15.470 --> 02:19.750
the destruction of those which are negative forces.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.750
But the Mahakali force is the one

02:23.070 --> 02:27.230
which is working out the constructive force

02:27.630 --> 02:32.430
but in that constructive force only there has to be destruction,

02:32.910 --> 02:37.870
because if you are constructing something and there is destruction

02:38.070 --> 02:42.070
which is trying to destroy your construction then you have to

02:42.350 --> 02:44.990
destroy that destructive personality;

02:45.590 --> 02:49.870
and this is what people sometimes misunderstand

02:50.310 --> 02:54.510
and they think that Mahakali force is negative force

02:54.710 --> 03:00.590
or is a force of destruction, it is, but in a very positive way

03:03.910 --> 03:07.070
and if you understand this part of Mahakali force

03:07.270 --> 03:10.910
then you will understand that if you have desires

03:11.270 --> 03:15.350
to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga

03:15.990 --> 03:19.630
then you should also have the desire to destroy

03:19.910 --> 03:24.150
whatever is standing against your construction.

03:25.750 --> 03:30.030
So one by one we should see within ourselves what sort of things

03:30.230 --> 03:35.870
that drag us down and thus they do not give us this desire.

03:36.310 --> 03:42.430
If this desire becomes intense then you start immediately

03:42.630 --> 03:47.870
seeing what are the forces that are destroying your ascent.

03:48.070 --> 03:53.270
So we have to ascend is the point, our goal is to ascend,

03:53.470 --> 03:56.910
our destination is to ascend; so our desire should be

03:57.390 --> 04:01.550
that we should ascend and construct our being in such a manner

04:02.030 --> 04:04.990
that we can receive all the...

04:16.550 --> 04:21.550
so we should understand that we have to be prepared

04:21.750 --> 04:24.150
to destroy many things within us,

04:24.390 --> 04:33.070
if we have to become great evolved personalities

04:33.270 --> 04:37.710
As you have seen in evolution itself you had huge big animals

04:37.910 --> 04:42.270
like mammoth this that and they they could not cope with the evolution

04:42.470 --> 04:46.390
so they were all destroyed, so many thing were destroyed,

04:47.790 --> 04:50.950
and this destruction is built in within us,

04:51.230 --> 04:55.310
when we ascend we just start seeing that these are the forces

04:55.790 --> 05:06.910
which are destroying us and that our destruction is so much

05:07.230 --> 05:11.230
that if we do not desire the destruction of these destructive forces

05:11.270 --> 05:13.270
we'll be finished.

05:14.070 --> 05:19.910
So at the same time, when we are ascending higher we have to know

05:20.110 --> 05:25.710
what we have to destroy. For example even in living forces

05:26.790 --> 05:31.230
when a flower becomes a fruit,

05:31.710 --> 05:38.750
lots of things which were the part of the flower get destroyed,

05:39.790 --> 05:44.510
automatically, but that is done in the will of God

05:44.750 --> 05:49.830
by His own understanding. So it's absolutely perfect.

05:50.110 --> 05:54.710
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something, we must know

05:54.910 --> 06:03.430
what we desire, first fix your goal and then relate it to that.

06:04.550 --> 06:08.190
Now there are many deviations in life, like you are going

06:08.390 --> 06:11.990
to the airport, our attention should be we have to reach the airport

06:12.350 --> 06:15.190
and whatever are distractions are distractions;

06:15.470 --> 06:16.830
we should not get lost with it,

06:17.110 --> 06:19.470
if you get lost with those distractions,

06:19.670 --> 06:22.710
then we cannot achieve our goal in time.

06:23.030 --> 06:29.830
So one has to understand first of all that our goal is to ascend

06:30.310 --> 06:37.510
and for that the distractions are on our way, because of ourselves,

06:37.710 --> 06:40.150
because of ignorance, because of darkness,

06:40.350 --> 06:42.910
because the light is not so much.

06:43.390 --> 06:47.670
The first destroying factor that is within us

06:48.550 --> 06:51.390
is the Shri Ganesha's power

06:52.710 --> 06:56.550
and this Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

06:57.510 --> 07:03.430
She first planted Shri Ganesha to emit holiness on this Earth,

07:04.030 --> 07:05.990
so the whole thing could be vibrated

07:06.230 --> 07:12.070
and as you know one aspect of Shri Ganesha is also Omkara,

07:12.430 --> 07:17.310
means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.

07:17.790 --> 07:23.110
So these vibrations have four sides in it:

07:23.630 --> 07:31.390
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

07:31.630 --> 07:36.950
auspiciousness through Mahakali power;

07:38.470 --> 07:46.390
then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahakali power.

07:48.430 --> 07:53.070
Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see,

07:53.470 --> 07:56.110
they do not give you desires,

07:56.310 --> 08:02.070
but they give you proof of your desires being fulfilled.

08:03.190 --> 08:07.190
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this is your desire

08:07.830 --> 08:12.430
and you give vibrations to that person; so it's a means,

08:14.830 --> 08:22.190
so it is also the action part which is there in those vibrations,

08:23.030 --> 08:27.150
but this action also comes from desire.

08:27.150 --> 08:30.550
If you don't have desire you won't act,

08:31.230 --> 08:38.430
so the desire is so important even to establish your own path,

08:38.670 --> 08:43.350
to establish your forward march, if your desire is poor,

08:43.550 --> 08:46.950
if you're half hearted you can't work it out.

08:47.750 --> 08:51.070
Half hearted people cannot achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga,

08:51.510 --> 08:55.350
it's not meant for half hearted people, it's meant for people

08:55.550 --> 09:03.150
who are brave, who have intense desire,

09:03.710 --> 09:10.430
who are intelligent and who are auspicious.

09:12.390 --> 09:19.830
But in case you do not have intense desire,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.750
then the pure desire doesn't work

09:22.950 --> 09:28.510
and you do not get your realisation; also after getting realisation

09:28.710 --> 09:32.870
unless and until you have desire to ascend,

09:33.350 --> 09:38.150
very strong intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

09:38.470 --> 09:42.510
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to first of all

09:42.710 --> 09:45.670
early in the morning, while taking the name of Ganesha,

09:45.950 --> 09:49.270
must say what is my desire, this is my goal,

09:49.590 --> 09:55.230
this is what it is, all activity must be surrendered for this work.

09:56.710 --> 10:03.830
So now how our desires are curbed, first of all

10:04.350 --> 10:08.270
through conditionings. We have certain conditionings.

10:08.950 --> 10:12.710
After Sahaja Yoga people become very affectionate,

10:13.310 --> 10:18.670
so immediately even if in the west - where the family is

10:18.870 --> 10:23.910
not so important, children are not so important,
selfishness is there,

10:24.710 --> 10:30.190
people think about themselves only, they cannot think of others -

10:30.550 --> 10:37.590
even in those countries, it starts developing a kind of a,

10:38.590 --> 10:45.430
another cocoon of myness, my child, my house, my home, my family;

10:48.230 --> 10:51.470
then the attention starts working on that,

10:51.750 --> 10:57.710
you become half hearted towards your ascent, because you're ascending

11:00.150 --> 11:06.030
in a way so called and also you are spreading out.

11:10.390 --> 11:16.710
Then the concern goes to other conditionings we have.

11:17.990 --> 11:20.910
Like the other day I met one fellow he said that "Mother,

11:21.150 --> 11:25.110
I'm a Sahaja Yogi, I know but I can't get over the idea of Christ",

11:25.190 --> 11:28.470
I said "Who has asked you to get over idea of Christ?

11:28.670 --> 11:31.550
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,

11:31.750 --> 11:35.310
but understand it in its own comprehensive way

11:36.070 --> 11:37.910
and see for yourself!".

11:38.110 --> 11:43.670
But this conditioning is of thoughts. Supposing if you have read

11:43.870 --> 11:48.230
too many books, if you have gone through...

11:48.430 --> 11:51.030
supposing you are a born Hindu or a born Christian

11:51.230 --> 11:55.470
or born Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

11:56.150 --> 12:01.150
You were born as a human being, you got this stamp later on

12:01.350 --> 12:04.950
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

12:05.150 --> 12:08.190
These stamps you did not carry when you were born.

12:08.710 --> 12:12.550
Supposing the child was lost, he could be any religion,

12:12.950 --> 12:16.790
so these are not really your innate religions,

12:17.270 --> 12:21.710
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian or anything.

12:22.390 --> 12:26.510
Then you have another conditioning, that you belong to this nation,

12:26.710 --> 12:31.950
that nation, like we have, we have America, this, that, that,

12:32.470 --> 12:36.310
but still these are stamps. You were born in America,

12:36.510 --> 12:40.870
that's why you are an American, anybody who is born in America

12:41.070 --> 12:43.550
is not different from anybody else.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.270
Only thing according to the climate of a particular place,

12:47.510 --> 12:51.390
you might have your complexion, your height, your face and all that,

12:51.630 --> 12:56.030
but that doesn't mean that innately this is meant for America,

12:56.070 --> 12:58.190
it could be anywhere.

12:58.990 --> 13:03.550
Then all these conditionings within us start acting on our language,

13:03.750 --> 13:07.070
on our styles, on our lives in every way.

13:07.270 --> 13:09.710
Then we start becoming Americans,

13:10.470 --> 13:13.630
so these are the effects of the outside that come in us

13:13.830 --> 13:16.150
and then we say we the Americans,

13:16.510 --> 13:24.510
but if you scratch them inside body's the same, heart is the same,

13:24.950 --> 13:28.150
the blood is the same, everything is the same,

13:28.350 --> 13:34.270
there's nothing different, it's even not skin deep.

13:34.630 --> 13:38.950
But in the brain it has gone that "I am an American".

13:40.350 --> 13:43.910
Then all these things that are in that society,

13:44.110 --> 13:50.030
for example in America so many things are allowed so that's alright,

13:51.030 --> 13:54.390
in India many things are allowed, that's alright,

13:54.790 --> 13:59.070
like that we start accepting the society, the norms of the society

13:59.270 --> 14:01.310
and the conditioning starts.

14:03.710 --> 14:10.790
But with all that, this desire is there, the pure desire to ascend.

14:13.590 --> 14:17.110
I think you put these lights little ahead because they are so,

14:17.310 --> 14:21.110
paper there and with my force, light is going behind,

14:24.830 --> 14:29.790
no, no, not that one please, because they are facing that fan,

14:33.470 --> 14:41.190
could bring them down here, still quite close to that fan you know,

14:41.430 --> 14:45.510
you can put them anywhere, you can put them here if you want,

14:54.990 --> 15:00.070
you see because my, the air is blowing that way and they are all going that way.

15:06.590 --> 15:11.790
So the desire within us to ascend comes to us

15:12.110 --> 15:14.470
also as a reaction to all these things,

15:16.870 --> 15:21.510
when we see as Americans what's happening to our country,

15:21.750 --> 15:26.510
what's happening to the people, what's happening to our surroundings

15:26.870 --> 15:31.750
and then we get a shock. Oh God! What is this?

15:32.550 --> 15:37.350
Then we also see this is artificiality, like in England

15:37.710 --> 15:39.950
you have to wear a tail coat, you have to wear this,

15:40.190 --> 15:44.470
you have to have this kind of spoon, this kind of a glass, this that

15:44.710 --> 15:48.550
so reaction builds in; so you start anti-culture,

15:50.190 --> 15:53.430
anti-culture to get rid of artificiality.

15:54.230 --> 15:58.830
Well the desire behind it is, is to seek the reality.

16:00.270 --> 16:04.510
To seek reality then they have hair just like primitive people,

16:04.710 --> 16:08.750
they live like primitive people and the reaction is built in

16:09.550 --> 16:12.790
behind all that is the same desire, is to ascend.

16:13.790 --> 16:18.030
So this Mahalakshmi power is acting within us,

16:18.470 --> 16:25.470
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can say, alright you want to have,

16:25.830 --> 16:30.750
say variety of things, go ahead with it, then you go crazy you see

16:31.150 --> 16:36.270
what is this going on, why should we be so mad about it.

16:36.950 --> 16:51.150
Now they want to have, a, you want to have say, your children,

16:51.430 --> 16:56.630
your home, your houses; then you just get fed up with it, because

16:57.230 --> 17:01.910
children become arrogant, they become horrid, they trouble you,

17:02.110 --> 17:05.310
then you say, "Oh God! I'll never have any children any more!"

17:05.870 --> 17:09.510
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible and husbands horrible,

17:09.790 --> 17:12.950
then you divorce, you go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing

17:13.190 --> 17:17.070
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't work out,

17:17.550 --> 17:21.990
nothing seems to work out, you feel so frustrated

17:22.390 --> 17:26.990
and that action and reaction works on your desires.

17:27.230 --> 17:29.790
So your desires go on changing,

17:31.310 --> 17:35.550
especially when we are wanting to be affluent,

17:37.390 --> 17:44.150
people become affluent and then they find the problems of affluence,

17:45.430 --> 17:47.670
so a reaction is built in,

17:48.830 --> 17:51.910
those who witness those problems of the rich,

17:52.230 --> 17:55.350
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

17:56.550 --> 18:01.430
So in every way the desire to achieve things works out,

18:01.670 --> 18:04.830
like some people want to have power, they go into politics,

18:04.950 --> 18:09.430
fight it, get it done and done forever.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.950
So lives after lives it goes on.

18:16.190 --> 18:20.590
Then you are born in modern times when I am here

18:21.030 --> 18:27.430
and now your only strong desire is to become The Spirit - I hope it is.

18:30.630 --> 18:36.230
So now all these back things are to be crossed over,

18:36.430 --> 18:42.110
they are finished, now what should we do for our realisation,

18:43.030 --> 18:45.310
what action we should take?

18:46.390 --> 18:51.510
The first action is to develop your Mahakali power,

18:52.830 --> 18:57.310
by one power you destroy all that is nonsensical,

18:57.710 --> 19:04.990
destroy all that is impeding you, troubling you, blocking you,

19:05.150 --> 19:08.310
destroy all that, just I don't want it.

19:12.190 --> 19:15.550
Because I have seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off,

19:16.310 --> 19:19.550
like you have to go to the airport, suddenly you find

19:19.750 --> 19:25.350
they have fallen into one of the gutters. "What happened?"

19:25.830 --> 19:30.270
"Mother, we felt like going there", but why?

19:32.110 --> 19:35.630
So keep your attention on that point.

19:37.950 --> 19:41.230
Some people get married, in Sahaja Yoga also,

19:41.470 --> 19:44.710
they have a desire to marry, have children, this thing,

19:44.910 --> 19:49.670
but in that also they get fixed up. Marriage is not the end,

19:49.910 --> 19:53.270
it's just one of the means to be balanced.

19:54.510 --> 20:02.030
So we have to have desire that we have to achieve something

20:02.230 --> 20:06.470
so go on destroying all that is within us, within us is there are

20:06.950 --> 20:16.070
six enemies as they say, is anger, then greed, jealousies, violence,

20:16.310 --> 20:21.110
all these are within us, so have to destroy these six enemies.

20:23.510 --> 20:28.470
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that she destroys

20:28.670 --> 20:31.750
all the enemies that stand in your way,

20:32.310 --> 20:35.590
all the rakshasas, all the devils all the negative forces,

20:35.710 --> 20:38.630
she tries to destroy, so that your [path] should be all right;

20:38.830 --> 20:40.510
but while She is destroying all of them

20:40.590 --> 20:44.310
if you are sticking on to them, what can She do?

20:44.550 --> 20:48.390
So your desire should be pure and that you should say that all right:

20:48.590 --> 20:52.710
"We want to achieve that", and she is working it out for you.

20:55.270 --> 20:58.470
This is the first thing, Her job.

20:59.670 --> 21:03.350
Then the second job is that She comforts,

21:03.630 --> 21:06.430
She gives you comforts, of every kind.

21:06.750 --> 21:09.950
The first comfort She gives you is of your body,

21:10.150 --> 21:15.110
your body becomes comfortable, means all your diseases and

21:15.310 --> 21:21.030
all your troubles are destroyed. You find that your body becomes

21:21.230 --> 21:24.390
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy

21:24.590 --> 21:27.790
and you can work out your realisation.

21:28.270 --> 21:32.750
This is the first thing She does for you: is to give you comfort.

21:33.150 --> 21:36.630
Then she also gives you comfort of the Spirit,

21:38.590 --> 21:45.750
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

21:46.110 --> 21:50.910
you can live anywhere, you can live in a jungle, you are comfortable;

21:51.270 --> 21:56.310
if you live in the most busiest place you are comfortable,

21:56.550 --> 22:00.550
so you are comfortable everywhere and that sort of a comfort

22:00.830 --> 22:03.230
she can establish within you.

22:04.830 --> 22:13.670
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She gives you the joy,

22:14.110 --> 22:23.030
joy of every kind, joy that emits from everything, from everyone.

22:23.790 --> 22:28.510
So that is the highest you get when you keep your desire,

22:28.710 --> 22:33.630
the flame of your desire burning, till you reach that state

22:33.830 --> 22:43.230
of spiritual attainment, then you find that no more desire is left;

22:43.590 --> 22:49.630
but only one, if it is any, that "let the whole world be realised".

22:50.030 --> 22:53.670
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy his drinking with others,

22:53.910 --> 22:57.310
like that you become, you are drunk in your joy and

22:57.510 --> 23:00.590
why not others enjoy, so you work for it.

23:03.310 --> 23:07.550
But human beings, I have seen, they move like a yo-yo,

23:07.910 --> 23:11.630
they achieve their spiritual attainment they have the joy

23:11.910 --> 23:16.230
and then they go back to help people, they get caught up with them,

23:16.670 --> 23:21.830
they are not strong enough; because the Mahakali power is not strong.

23:22.590 --> 23:27.150
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

23:28.670 --> 23:34.510
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced

23:34.950 --> 23:38.150
and in that imbalance you lose your will.

23:38.830 --> 23:43.550
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara must be fixed properly.

23:45.430 --> 23:49.150
There are so many ways by which you can fix up your Mooladhara

23:49.470 --> 23:52.510
and you must fix up your Mooladhara first;

23:52.710 --> 23:59.430
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite moves in the sky,

23:59.910 --> 24:03.710
stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into any direction

24:03.910 --> 24:08.030
to any height, wherever you go you are quite in charge,

24:08.230 --> 24:10.150
you know how you are moving.

24:13.950 --> 24:17.910
It can bind your attention, everything. So what we say that

24:18.190 --> 24:23.310
the roots are very important first to be established

24:23.630 --> 24:27.470
for the growth of your desire upward, like a tree.

24:29.030 --> 24:33.750
So they go hand in hand, Mahakali power and Ganesha's power

24:33.950 --> 24:38.870
go hand in hand because that's the foundation;

24:39.230 --> 24:44.070
if it is based on that foundation, desires grow much stronger

24:44.390 --> 24:49.790
and stronger and effective and they do not deviate.

24:51.270 --> 24:57.470
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you reach that state where

24:57.990 --> 25:02.430
there's no other desire left but to enjoy, you just enjoy,

25:02.630 --> 25:07.150
without any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

25:10.590 --> 25:14.630
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be enjoyed.

25:14.910 --> 25:18.630
What is there to talk about it? What is there to say about it?

25:18.830 --> 25:23.550
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment

25:25.190 --> 25:32.430
and that should happen everywhere and that's what you are worshipping.

25:32.870 --> 25:36.110
So now I hope you have hundred and eight names of Mahakali,

25:36.310 --> 25:38.430
and if you have the hundred and eight names of Mahakali

25:38.630 --> 25:46.470
you will see one by one that her these stages are working out for you,

25:46.910 --> 25:52.190
how manifest that you can see in those names.

25:52.630 --> 25:57.710
So now first we'll have a one Atarva Sheersha

25:57.910 --> 26:01.310
and then we can have these hundred and eight names.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.750
