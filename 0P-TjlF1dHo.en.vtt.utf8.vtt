00:00:12.329 --> 00:01:12.139
Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha
Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birth.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:29.060
In the whole
map of time, Buddha came to this earth at

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.320
a time when it was so important for Him to
come.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:57.240
That time, especially in India, we had two
types of people: one, who were very ritualistic,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:18.260
trying to be extremely strict and disciplined;
and the another were the people who were

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.819
too much conditioned and were full of so-called
devotion to God.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:46.610
So these two types of people were occupying
the area of seekers.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:57.879
So it was necessary to neutralize these two
styles of seekings.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:15.250
Buddha and Mahavira are, in essence, supported
by Hanumana and Bhairava - that is, as you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.790
know, Gabriel and Saint Michael.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:32.890
The principle that took birth is the principle
of a disciple, and this principle was born

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.470
much earlier as the two sons of Shri Rama.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:53.390
This principle was brought on this earth and
incarnated: one, to conquer the ego of human

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.879
beings; another one, to conquer the superego
of human beings.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:11.939
Buddha, when He was born, He found that there
was misery everywhere.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:20.970
And the misery, according to Him, was due
to the desires we have.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.990
So to be desireless is the best way to achieve
Nirvana.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.660
That's what He came to conclusion.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.810
But how to become desireless?

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:44.990
You are sitting in the sand, and if you see,
the sand doesn't get attached to anything.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.970
You put anything on it, it will not spoil
anything.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:57.590
You put water, it will stick on, and as soon
as you try to throw it away the whole thing

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.100
will disappear into thin air.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:21.850
So to develop that kind of detachment, or
to develop a life which was desireless was

00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:23.479
His aim.

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:27.940
And that's why I say He was a Disciple Principles.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:40.280
So, the Disciple Principle has to find out
the way and method, while the Guru Principle

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.729
are the people who have already found out.

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.940
Because He has to create a way and path.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.670
So, He studied all kinds of books, went to
many places.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.860
He read Upanishadas.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.889
Then He saw the people who are busy with Vedas
and were doing all kinds of ritualism.

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:16.530
With the rituals, they never got the Realization,
which is actually the first verse of Veda

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:24.569
is that, "By reading the Vedas and by doing
all the rituals of the Vedas, if you do not

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:33.229
become vida, means self-realized, vida word
means "to know", if you don't know the Divine

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:42.139
on your central nervous system, then you are
just missing the point.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.600
It is all useless for you to read Vedas.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.979
So He went into various areas of search.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:07:04.720
As today we find many seekers have been going
to many people to find out the truth.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.810
And He was tired, very tired.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:19.160
He thought all His seeking, all His working
hard, all His efforts, everything had just

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.460
made Him tired.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.860
And He thought it was all fruitless.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:40.949
So, He was lying under a Banyan tree, and
there the Adi Shakti gave Him Realization.

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:53.260
When all your searches are over - people search
in money, in power, in love, and all kinds

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.260
of things.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:03.370
Ultimately people start searching in various
groups, cults, gurus, all kinds of things

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.550
- drugs, alcohol's, whichever way are possible
they try to search.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:16.030
But when human beings try to search something,
then in their movement they either go to the

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.680
left or to the right.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:29.229
And He, being such an ardent seeker, and such
a truthful seeker, He could see very clearly

00:08:29.229 --> 00:08:33.680
that this is not the point of going left or
right.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.770
But there has to be some ascent, but how to
achieve it?

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.760
Who is going to give Him Self-Realization?

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:51.100
All that tiredness He laid down Himself under
the tree and suddenly He got His Realization.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:09:04.750
When He got His Realization, He started understanding
why this problem of conditioning and ego is

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.750
there.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:15.550
He found out one thing: that people when they
read too much, and try to understand - through

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.690
ritualism - God, then they develop their ego.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:27.030
The other side, He found out, that when people
just with some desires, go on praying to God,

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:33.450
"Give me this, give me that", they become
mad.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:42.020
And when He realized it, then only at that
moment when He was tired, He got His Realization.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:48.000
This is exactly what is happening today in
the modern times.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.700
That those who were seekers have been seeking
the Divine on the left and right hand side.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.320
Nowadays they are jogging.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.550
I don't know what they're going to achieve
through jogging.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.060
They're jogging like mad.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:14.280
Then there are ardent Christians, ardent Muslims,
fighting the whole world for their religion,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.700
for their God, for in the name of Mohammed
Sahib, in the name of Krishna, in the name

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.860
of everything.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.810
Then they think their religion is in danger.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.600
I mean it is not.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:39.000
Neither the prophets nor the incarnations,
nobody is in danger, not at all.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.100
How can they be?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.460
And no religion if it is true religion can
be in danger.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.520
But this He only realized after His Realization.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:01.890
But His followers who came did not see the
point that ultimately it is Self-Realization

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.030
He is talking.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:09.670
Actually he took all the care to see that
people should get their Self-Realization first.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.960
Then anything else.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.430
First of all He said, "You are not going to
worship Me."

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:26.630
As you know we don't allow people to come
for My Puja unless and until they are fully

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.420
established in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:36.240
So He first said that, "You should be fully
established in your Self-Realization, that's

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.680
all."

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:46.910
He would not talk about God, because once
you start talking about God, then He saw all

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.440
these horrible religions coming up in the
name of God.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.920
When I first came to America, you will be
surprised, I did not talk of God, I did not

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.090
talk of bhoots, I did not talk of any religion.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.660
I just talked about Self-Realization.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:15.000
The reason was, I thought, if you get your
Self-Realization then you'll understand the

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:28.510
rest of it, but no use talking to you -

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:38.190
about God or about Divine because first thing
is you must have your eyes, you must have

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.640
the light, otherwise what's the use of talking
about these things.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.960
But it so happened that Buddha did not give
anybody Realization.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.980
So it was all right for Him to talk about
the Spirit and not about God or any religion,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:01.190
to such an extent that people say that Buddha
was an atheist - He did not believe in God.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:10.060
No, it was a matter of His policy that He
did not want to talk about God.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:19.680
But what I found when I came to America that
this world is full of all kinds of things.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.680
Firstly the tremendous ego that they have.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.870
And secondly they are so much conditioned.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:40.390
There were so many witchcrafts and forces,
I mean openly they are saying, "This is a

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.590
witchcraft's school."

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.590
Openly.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.410
Or, "This is a satanic powers school."

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.160
All kinds, I was surprised, openly saying
like that.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:57.500
And when I came to San Diego first, because
I came on My own, and the people who invited

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:04.610
Me had an organization called "parapsychology"
- is all bhoots.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:11.750
So they took Me round in a huge, big hall
and there were lots of people sitting down

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.270
and I saw all the bhoots.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.140
(Shri Mataji laughing) I said, "Now what should
I do?

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.140
Should I say the truth or not?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.160
They might start getting angry with Me."

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.920
But I said, "Better to tell them, because
once they are lost in the bhoots, then what

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.660
will I do with them?"

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.070
So I told them, "This is all wrong, this is
all bhootish, it is all nonsense, you just

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:40.960
don't fall a prey to all these things, this
is not correct, you better get your Realization!"

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.220
And see, some people did get Realization,
and some people did leave that organization.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:58.160
Now, last time when I came I discovered in
'83 that the lady who was in charge sort of

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:09.640
a person, has become mad and the gentleman
who was organizing all that has become bankrupt

00:15:09.841 --> 00:15:13.939
and has gone to Australia and the building
has collapsed.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.020
The bhoots must have done the job.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:27.710
It was such a problem for Me in those days
to talk against all this nonsense.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.710
Then I went to some churches, they invited
Me.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:35.840
Now, in the church suddenly I found eight
or ten bhootish people got up and started

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.840
dancing.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.700
I said, "Where am I now?"

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:47.380
(Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter) I am here to
tell them about the Spirit and see the condition

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.380
here.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:55.180
What am I to tell them and they ardently
believed that I was an agent of God, of course,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.440
but God meaning bhoot.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:04.920
It was impossible to understand how far people
have gone.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:12.960
At the same time there was an onslaught of
all the fake gurus at that time and when I

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.420
said, "You cannot pay for it" they said, "You
better go back.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.240
We don't want you."

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.990
So I went away and then came back after nine
years.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:36.830
So Buddha tried to talk only about Self-Realization
and not about God at all.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:46.160
But His followers as they are always one better
than the other, tried to create a Buddhism

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.380
of their own style.

00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:54.849
And in this Buddhism, whatever He had told,
they did not observe it.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:17:01.140
Firstly He thought if there is ritualism and
puja an all that, before Realization where

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.600
will they land up?

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:12.280
So He said, "All right, you do not do any
puja to Me!

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.679
Do not built any monument in My name!

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:20.510
You should not worship anything!"

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.810
So what did they do?

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:29.340
They are worshipping His teeth, they are worshipping
His nails, they are worshipping His hair.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:40.730
Now say, for example, if you get My hair and
you are not a Realized Soul, what is the difference

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.930
between My hair or anybody's hair?

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.620
Just the same.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:51.950
Without Realization all this worship took
them to very bhootish area.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:58.070
That's how we find the Buddhists who are nowhere
near Buddha.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:03.750
Like if you go to Japan, you can't believe
they can be Buddhist.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.100
They are supposed to be Buddhist - Buddha
who is the compassionate.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:16.350
Then we have got Chinese who followed Buddhism.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.650
They couldn't understand Buddhism either.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:27.310
And we have Tibetans where we had these horrible
lamas and we had other people in Ladakh and

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.310
all that.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:35.060
They are all doing nothing else but bhoot-vidya,
prita-vidya, smashaan vidya.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.890
So even His advent amounted to the same thing
as everybody's.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:51.270
Now Buddha told three things which are very
important, which are very useful for Sahaja

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.880
Yogis to follow.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:02.760
He said, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.920
- I surrender myself to the enlightened one."

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.990
Means what?

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.900
I surrender myself to the one who is enlightened.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.590
In this case one can say it was Buddha.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.350
In your case it is your Spirit.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.540
You surrender yourself to your Spirit.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.260
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.770
Buddha means the one which knows.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:42.020
Then He says another thing, "Dhammam Sharanam
Gachami" means surrender yourself to the religion,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.110
which is true religion, which is the balance.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:55.820
Now as you see, all these man-made religions
are so funny and you can't make much out of

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820
them.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:02.980
You can't explain if these are religions or these
are Mafias.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:14.690
The reason is, Buddha said, "You surrender
yourselves to Dharma."

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:21.040
So the Buddhist thought, "surrender to Dharma"
means what you have to do is to become like

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:28.790
Buddhist - means wear a dress like a Buddhist,
like Buddha used to wear.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:34.480
You don't become by wearing that dress Buddha,
do you?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.050
Or then they thought, "We should do something
more."

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:46.960
So some Buddhist got hold of a wheel, because
He talked of a wheel-of-life and all that.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:54.539
Absolutely, I should say, very unintelligent
way of understanding Buddha.

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:58.600
And they would go on, you see, moving that
wheel like mad.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.090
You can't talk to them.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.010
You say, "Now, where is that road?"

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.010
"Buddha."

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.500
(Laughter) "How do we go there?"

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.710
(Laughter) Everything has an answer.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.560
So I said, "Please answer Me."

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.130
"This is the answer."

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:25.220
So what is this answer going on?

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.990
Then these people thought we should find out
new methods.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:39.280
So some of them took to again Upanishadas
and started using also from there, making

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:48.040
jataka kathas like the stories which are very
absurd, funny stories, mysterious stories,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.280
this story, that story.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:22:04.150
At the same time Hinduism took another funny
role and they had a big assault of tantrikas.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:14.600
And when the tantrikas came in they brought
all kinds of ugly, horrible things in the

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:21.780
- say about the sixth century it started.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:34.370
And a complete belt starting beyond Calcutta
going towards Dwarika, complete belt got involved

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.410
into tantrism.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:42.120
So the same Buddhist later on, followed the
same tantric methods.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:50.020
So they tried to bring in everything from
this place, that place and a mixture, so now

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:56.750
if you ask, "Now what's your religion?" they
say, "I'm Buddhist."

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.970
"What Buddhist?"

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.800
- "Dinayan, hinayan,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.300
I'm Zen - this, that, all kinds of Buddhism is
there.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:10.720
Is impossible to understand really where is
Buddhism there.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.830
So what do these do?

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.890
One will shave their hair.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.950
One will shave their moustache.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.340
Another one will wear this kind of a dress.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.630
(Shri Mataji laughing) This is the only difference
between from one to another.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:29.430
But the common point is that they are all
cheats, they all can deceive you, they can

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.430
tell lies without feeling funny.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.650
They are very sly, very cunning and suicidal.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:44.810
They can be very violent and the only desire
they have is to kill everybody who comes across.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:52.680
This is where Buddha's Buddhism has ended
up.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.530
So now we are face to face with Buddha.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:05.480
But what He talked about was a spontaneous
happening of Self-Realization.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.440
And He said, "You prepare yourself."

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:15.059
All the time He said, "You prepare yourself
for Self-Realization and try to watch everything

00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:16.059
without desire."

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:21.230
This was just preparation for Sahaja Yoga
He was talking about.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:35.980
But as you see, all the Buddhists today, if
you see them you'll be amazed that they are

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.620
neither here nor there.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:43.070
You just don't know how to place them, how
to understand them, how to make them feel

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.750
what Buddha taught or Zen has taught.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.140
They are not in a condition to understand
anything.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:59.690
It's like, you see, the brain of a person
who is having all kinds of thoughts, like

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.530
all the pebbles in one little pot, making
noise.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.270
God knows which one is making which noise.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:15.000
And that's why today you find here is one
Lama, who was a guru of Hitler.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.490
Imagine: Hitler's guru was Lama!

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:24.100
Now this mister Lama is going round the whole
world with his wrinkles which can be counted

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.720
one by one and asking for money.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.270
Why does he want money for?

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:39.380
He is the one who ran away from Tibet, from
Lhasa.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.590
And while running away he carried such a lot
of gold with him that he could not carry.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:48.730
So half of it he dropped it in the river and
with the half of it he reached India.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:55.240
With the half of it already he has made a
huge, big Buddha of gold, he has too much

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.440
gold with him.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:05.970
And the rest of the gold that was salvaged,
was taken to Russia - to China, where I've

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.600
seen it Myself.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600
Amazed.

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:16.319
He had gold, beer mugs, what you call
them, the huge, big things, like that.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.680
Real gold.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.690
And such big plates of real gold for eating
food.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.690
Imagine!

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:32.740
Buddha talked of detachment, and they had
everything in gold or silver of a very expensive

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.460
quality.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.930
If you see their robe, clothes and all that
you'd be amazed.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:46.250
Though they wore all those things as robes
of renunciation, but whenever they sat in

00:26:46.049 --> 00:26:54.529
their own courtyard - courts and things like
that, inside all that they wore - inside wore

00:26:54.730 --> 00:27:02.920
all those dresses which were very heavily
done with real gold, with pearls and things,

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.400
because I've seen with My own eyes.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.550
I was amazed.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.370
So it is like somebody who says, "Oh, I must
get detached.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.230
Now I'm going to the seashore.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.470
I'm going to sit there and meditate."

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.890
There he goes, and makes a compound round
himself.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:28.550
So I ask him, "Why have you made a compound?", "You
know, maybe thieves might come in."

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.230
I mean you are detached what does it matter
if a thief comes, he will take you away, so

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.230
what?

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.610
You are there, doesn't matter, you can go
with a thief, you can go with anyone.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.370
Why are you worried about the thief?

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.680
You are detached.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.380
"Oh, you see, I am also worried that there
might be pick-pockets."

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.930
"So why are you worried about pick-pockets?"

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:54.710
"Because maybe I have some money with me here,
and I have my bank account and I have my other, other

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:59.049
things with me, so I am rather worried, see,
that a thief might come."

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.320
So why do you talk of detachment?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.620
Why do you talk of sanyasa?

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:14.580
So this kind of a nonsensical sanyasa started
after Buddha died, which was so very shocking.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:23.580
This led people to think that you can wear
any time an orange dress and then you are

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.580
a sanyasi.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.940
If you wear an orange dress you become Buddha,
and you become a detached personality.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:36.240
Now you can announce to the whole world that,
"I'm a detached personality" and what is your

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240
background?

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:42.679
"Nothing, I just was born out of this Mother
Earth and I'm sitting here nicely like Buddha."

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:46.440
So people stupidly start giving them money.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.809
So they get the money.

00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:54.070
But actually, the background is that the fellow
might have come out of the jail in India for

00:28:54.070 --> 00:29:00.900
burglary or something like that, and now sitting
down here as Buddha.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.260
How will you make out?

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:08.540
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:14.570
So what we have to do is to establish ourselves
in Buddha.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.250
That is to establish within ourselves in our
Spirit.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:27.960
Unless and until we are established in our
Spirit, we cannot understand the intricacies

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.800
of all the ignorance that we have around.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:40.530
So the best way to understand Sahaja Yoga
is to establish yourself in the Spirit.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:49.290
But those who are not intelligent, those who
are stupid, those who are selfish and greedy

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.790
do not see this point.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:30:00.110
And they do not like it if a leader tells
them that, "You must establish in Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.250
that you should have your Spirit manifested."

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.270
They don't want to listen to it.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:11.190
They want to be in the group of Sahaja Yogis
because they don't want to be lonely.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:19.950
They would like to sing songs, music, everything
in Sahaja Yoga because they want somewhere

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:26.150
to fit in, because they want an identity,
they call themselves Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:31.200
But this identity is a false identity.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.950
You have to be identified with your Spirit.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.580
That is the part is, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.060
The second is, "Dhammam Sharanam Gachami."

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.330
What is "Dhammam", is Dharma.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.700
What is our Dharma, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.559
That means now we have become universal beings.

00:30:55.559 --> 00:31:05.130
We are no more Indians, no more Africans,
no more English, no more French.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:19.960
We all have become now Sahaja Yogis who are
the citizens of the Kingdom of God.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.170
We have no other identification.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.780
This is our Dharma.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:32.920
We are now leading a universal life.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:40.070
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:47.140
Still, so many of them still identify themselves
with some localized stuff.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:56.630
Now when we think of universality we have
to understand, that it's not only the religion

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:03.050
or a country that separates us, but also a
kind of a quality.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:10.350
For example, if there are people who are Rajo-gunis
who are very active, right-sided people, they'll

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.590
combine together.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.190
They may fight later but they combine.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:22.549
Then the people who are left-sided will combine
together, but both of these should cling onto

00:32:22.348 --> 00:32:30.959
those who are trying to ascend, who are in
the center.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.820
And there where we fail very much.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:46.830
Our associations and our understandings of
each other is deluded by our ignorance and

00:32:46.830 --> 00:33:00.200
we cannot understand who is for our ascent
and who is for our benevolence.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.020
This happens with us in so many ways.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:10.570
We are universal beings and our culture is
"Sahaja Culture."

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.690
We have given up all our nonsensical cultures.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:21.650
In every religion, in every country we have
seen the nonsense of our culture, so we believe

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.929
in the spontaneous culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:28.860
So we are universal beings.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:38.110
And in this state of being universal being
you have to develop your collective consciousness.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:49.990
As first one is for individual, "Buddham Sharanam
Gacchami" - I surrender myself to Buddha.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:57.300
The second one is the one, I surrender myself
to the collective - in the sense, into the

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.860
Dharma, the essence of the collective.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.030
Now what is the essence of our collective?

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:11.000
What binds us together is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,
the Pure Religion of the Universe.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:19.119
So once you understand that this is the thing
that binds you to each other, you must understand

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:24.320
how important it is to keep to Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:32.110
In so many ways I have been able to tell you
what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:43.409
So we have to understand the full content
of the Dharma that we are following and also

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:50.100
to reflect it back to see, "Are we really
following this religion?"

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.090
But in falsehood I have seen like somebody's
a Christian.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:35:00.650
Every Sunday he'll get up, dress up nicely,
go to the church, get up three times, four

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:05.970
times, sing songs, this thing, do everything,
pay the money to the priest, pay to the church,

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:14.430
pay to that, and then he thinks he has done
the job.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.470
Very religiously he'll go and confess.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:22.640
Muslims, very religiously will do some things
which we cannot really understand.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:30.160
As in Spain I was told that people try
to crucify themselves, as a drama of course,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:38.890
but they do it just to protect Christianity
I think, and to crucify - God knows what!

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:46.710
Then there are people in India who are following
Hinduism and the first principle, the basic

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.910
principle of Hinduism, that there is Spirit
in everyone.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:55.890
So how can you have caste and subcaste and this and that?

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.760
If everybody has the Spirit you can't have
caste, subcaste.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.610
You cannot have division like that.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:10.650
So what we find in every religion, there are
problematic things but once you come to this

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:17.369
pure religion, then you see the essence of
it and the essence of it is that, that we

00:36:17.369 --> 00:36:24.240
are all Spirit and we are all related to each
other, we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.100
So you go to the collective.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.610
So at the end He said, "Sangham Sharanam Gachami."

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.380
This is the very important point also.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:42.770
It's the most important thing is this "Sangham
Sharanam Gachami."

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:50.200
For example, we say that you surrender yourself
to collectivity.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.220
What does that mean?

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.680
What does that entail (it is)?

00:36:52.680 --> 00:37:03.230
As I was talking to your leaders here, I said,
"All of you should form one collective unit,

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.940
a 'Sangham'."

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:12.020
All the leaders have to know that they love
Mother from their heart, and they should never

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:23.410
try to cut each other because somebody's trying
to tell them against them.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.402
They should have love for each other.

00:37:26.402 --> 00:37:28.290
For example there's one Mr. X, who's a leader.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:37.420
Now a negative force incarnates and comes
and tells the leader that, "See the other

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.670
leader is my supporter."

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:45.510
So this fellow has a bad feeling, the another
leader has another bad feeling.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.220
This is going against "Sangha."

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:54.270
First the Sangha of the collectivity of the
leaders has to be fully appreciated.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.390
I enjoy the way when all these leaders meet
and beat each other nicely and enjoy each

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:08.310
other, pull each other's legs and love each
other and patronize the younger ones and look

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.310
after.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:10.470
That's the beginning of Sangha.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:15.630
If the leaders are not in Sangha, what other
Sangha we can form?

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.990
So the first is the Sangha of the leaders
is there.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:25.110
All those who try to break that Sangha must
know that they are negative people and they

00:38:24.909 --> 00:38:27.669
are going to stab us.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:32.260
Anybody who tries that, you should be very
careful.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:37.490
The second Sangha, collectivity, is among
the Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:46.290
Now we are not, as I told you, Indians, or
we are not English or Americans or anything,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.780
so we should not form groups.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:55.230
What you'll find always, if there are five
Americans they'll stick on to each other as

00:38:55.029 --> 00:38:58.999
if they have been glued, and they can't move
away from each other.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.590
All of them will be together.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:05.369
If there are Indians, they will stick on together.

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:10.690
If there are other kinds, they'll all stick
on together.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.460
Now we are no more that.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.859
It's finished!

00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:17.080
So what is there to glue to each other?

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.430
But it happens.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.910
We always glue to each other.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.300
I don't know why.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.130
What is the need to do that?

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:32.620
And very commonly we see that in India people
are behaving in a very funny manner.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:38.730
Last year I did not know, but people told
Me that some group came and they were all

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:46.390
the time saying, "We are a great nation, we
are a great nation."

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:50.340
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:40:01.060
Our nation is Kingdom of God and our King
is God Almighty and we have no other King

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.730
and no other nation.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:14.390
If you cannot transcend those barriers of
stupid limitations you cannot become Sahaja

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.590
Yogis.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.720
But this is in a very gross way.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:28.700
But in a very subtle way, I see a lady who
is catching or who has badha will immediately

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.830
crawl into another one - somehow.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:34.260
She may belong to any country, doesn't matter.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:44.120
You see, a bhootish woman, say, coming from
India, will crawl up to another one in Australia.

00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:45.659
Straight forward, march!

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.360
Just start watching, "Where is she going?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.710
Oh God, that's it!"

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:58.190
So the bhoots are very collective, a big fraternity,
great fraternity.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:03.890
If they see somebody who is possessed, this
bhootish person will immediately go to her.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:11.070
It is very surprising that the bhoots are
so collective.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.270
Apart from that, they know Me very well.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.210
They understand Me very well.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:24.190
Even a little child if he is caught up will
start crying before Me, shaking before Me,

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.980
not coming before Me.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:32.820
But when they are realized, they don't understand
and moreover they don't understand a simple

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:38.230
principle that we are now possessed by our
own Spirit and we are one.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:49.470
So they should stick on more to the person
who is a spiritually evolved personality.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:57.490
But instead of that, for them some "third-rater"
something is much more important than a person

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.480
who is such a highly developed person.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.330
This is where we fail in our collective.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:09.619
A very subtle method of these negative people.

00:42:09.619 --> 00:42:14.160
Just finding out how to form a big formidable
group to attack.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.720
With that you lose your vibrations.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:27.060
Once you lose your vibrations then you say,
"Oh, this is too much.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.980
We must have compassion.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.950
We must have love.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.800
After all we are all Sahaja Yogis."

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.200
So it's the compassion and love of bhoots
among themselves.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.930
They are talking of compassion to each other.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:50.660
Even with Me they said, "Mother, you have
to be kind."

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:58.000
I said, "Are you more compassionate than Me
that you are teaching Me?"

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:07.830
If I'm saying anything to this lady taking
all My breath and all My energy on her, then

00:43:07.629 --> 00:43:12.659
I'm doing it for her benevolence and it's
My compassion that is [why/working], but what you

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:21.070
are doing is not for the benevolence but for
the destruction of that person.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:27.170
So no use supporting someone who is negative.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:32.470
Many negative persons who have been asked
to get out of Sahaja Yoga sometimes create

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:39.430
this problem of coming, "Oh Mother, you know,
I'm so good, but they tortured me, they troubled

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.580
me so much."

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.570
Now I'm seeing a bhoot in the person.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.890
I can clearly see.

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:51.810
I can see the negativity, but if you do not
see, you will immediately start taking sides,

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:56.750
"Oh God, look at this, poor thing is tortured."

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:02.570
You lose your vibrations, you won't be able
to find out!

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:07.460
So don't come under the spell of these murmuring
souls, as Christ has called.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:12.610
He said, "Murmuring souls are the greatest
danger."

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.520
That I've seen in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:22.880
Those who murmur, talk at the back, go on
complaining are the greatest danger to Sahaja

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.860
Yoga and ultimately to themselves.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.849
Because they'll be found out.

00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:38.410
So this is the another situation into which
we are not collective and when we are collective,

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:46.750
we are collective for something which is not
ascending force.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:59.990
It is something surprising how we see people
in this world are inviting their destruction

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:10.000
and we too, in a way, when we don't understand
what is collectivity, try to destroy our body

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.810
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:21.850
Today I'm telling you this because all these
things must be stopped now on the day of Buddha's

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.119
birth.

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:29.690
Buddha is the one who is in charge of your
ego.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:38.010
If you go beyond Buddha and start showing
off too much, then He pushes your ego into

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.640
your left Vishuddhi.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:45.320
So you develop your left Vishuddhi and when
you develop your left Vishuddhi, what happens?

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.920
That you start feeling guilty, meaning you
do not want to face the situation at all,

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.830
but you say "Oh, I'm very guilty.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:58.390
I've killed you, all right, I've killed you,
I'm feeling guilty."

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.020
We never face the situation.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:06.930
This is the ego which goes into the left and
creates this problem of left Vishuddhi.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:14.280
It's not by any chance your style of bearing
up things, or you are being suppressed.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:25.320
But no, you have been oppressing others, you
have been egoistical and it has been so much

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:33.680
that it has gone into the left Vishuddhi.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.790
So you are trying to justify.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:43.820
Now I would suggest that if you really want
to understand Sahaja Yoga, first try to understand

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.390
yourself.

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:51.890
Then you see, "Where is my mind going now?"

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:56.599
Some ladies who are used to, say gossip, they
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:56.599 --> 00:47:03.530
They are all right, but sometimes that thing
comes, "Let's go and gossip about this lady".

00:47:03.329 --> 00:47:09.689
They'll just get up, walk on to another one who
must have been gossiped in last life, maybe.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:15.360
So go and talk to that person and tell something
against that person.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:23.380
(Shri Mataji laughing) Then they find out
another gossiper or they get another gossiper.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:27.980
Now, what I find is three great Sahaja Yoginis
are sitting and gossiping there.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.980
I say, "What are you talking?"

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.080
"Oh, no Mother, we were discussing Sahaja
Yoga."

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.010
I said, "Really?"

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:46.200
(Laughter) Discussing Sahaja Yogis is never
discussion on Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.990
If you are discussing people you are not discussing
Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:48:00.160
Discussing Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do with
human beings or with Realized souls.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:08.849
Thank God, you don't discuss Me, because I
must be making lots of mistakes.

00:48:08.849 --> 00:48:15.410
In relation to your culture, in relation to
your styles, in relation to the human style.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:18.820
For example, you have to say, "Thank you"
ten times.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.580
I might be saying it only three times or four
times.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.310
Or you have to say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry."

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:30.410
On the telephone even now, I never say sorry,
I say, "I beg your pardon?"

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.700
But you see, people will say, "Sorry, sorry,
sorry."

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:39.370
I start thinking, "Am I in the wrong or they
are in the wrong?"

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.370
(Laughter)

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:54.180
So when we start discussing others, what we
really do is to confront or to face someone

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.240
with your own limitations.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:04.440
And we start thinking, "He should have done
like this, he should have ..." What about

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440
you?

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:14.160
So best is, you discuss yourself with yourself
and you discuss Sahaja Yoga with others.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.280
This is the best way to get rid of one of
the greatest enemies of collectivity, is gossip.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:26.510
Is a human nature, you know, I think, to gossip.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:36.910
Another horrible thing we have, which Buddha
has tried to control, is a very subtle type

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.279
of aggressiveness.

00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:44.510
That one of the games I play is of making
somebody a leader.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.270
It's a game, please remember.

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:49.400
Even if I tell you, "I'm Mahamaya", you forget
it.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.160
Even if I tell you, "I'm playing a game",
still you forget it.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.640
You become so seriously leaders, you see.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.500
It's nothing to feel that you are leaders,
there's nothing like leaders, there's nothing

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.950
like that in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.230
But then I praise some.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:12.310
Now I had a mind to praise people today for
yesterday's program.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:17.970
The way it was arranged, the way it was done
beautifully, so many people came, is remarkable.

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:22.600
But then I was thinking, "Should I say or
not?"

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:31.280
(Laughter) If I say, next time, God knows
what I will see.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:39.400
(Laughter) So encouraging like this, will
it help or not?

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.370
So I've been still discreet about it.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:48.849
Of course, I must say, yesterday's program
was very remarkable and we must really give

00:50:48.849 --> 00:50:58.130
a hand to Dave and to the leader, our Karan.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.060
(Applause)

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:19.180
Despite all stupid opposition and nonsense,
they have shown how they have brought in so

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:26.350
many people to Sahaja Yoga and how with complete
concentration they have been able to establish

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:32.619
so many in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:32.619 --> 00:51:41.100
So it is for you to learn from it, that despite
all problems and anything, without feeling

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:50.940
bad about it, just see that you move like
a big elephant towards giving Realization

00:51:50.940 --> 00:52:01.640
to others, creating more Sahaja Yogis and
more Sahaja Yogis in America.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:08.869
Those who had this aim in life that we have
to give Realization to people, we have to

00:52:08.869 --> 00:52:19.380
achieve establishment of Sahaja Yoga, they
never will have any problems of any kind.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:26.740
So never bring down yourself to the level
where you think that, "See, the food was not

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:33.170
good, that was not good, this one was not
good, this fellow was torturing, that fellow

00:52:32.969 --> 00:52:34.799
was doing this."

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Nothing.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.670
This is not going to help you, help anyone.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:43.160
Not going to give you any marks, as they say.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:48.680
After all if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God, one has to know that you have to have

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.690
certain marks.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:56.280
Otherwise God will say, "You failed", (Laughter)
and you'll be surprised why the entrance is

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.560
not allowed.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:03.900
You are thinking you are so intelligent, so
great, you see, how much gossip you have created,

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.820
how much problems you have created, how many
leaders you have pulled down, how much you

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.310
have befooled Mother and all that.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:15.510
(Laughter) And there suddenly you find, "I've
failed.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.930
(Laughter) What has happened?"

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:22.320
So don't deceive your Self.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.530
Self is the Spirit.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.410
Don't deceive your Self.

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:34.430
If you deceive yourself, ultimately you will
be deceived and despite the fact you have

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:40.369
been Sahaja Yogis, you have been to My Puja,
you have been here and you have been certified

00:53:40.168 --> 00:53:44.579
as Sahaja Yogis, there's light on your head,
still they will say, "Take another life,

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.040
and then come back.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:55.380
Take another as, you see, failed, you have
to go through one year more.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.180
Try another one."

00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.180
(Laughter)

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:04.320
So the easiest way to be a good Sahaja Yogi,
not to deceive your Self.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.000
Watch yourself!

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.710
Where is this mind going?

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.710
What am I thinking?

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:13.480
What is my mind working now?

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:21.710
Can I, this man is coming, can I give him
Realization?

00:54:21.509 --> 00:54:23.273
Should I start talking to him about Sahaja Yoga?

00:54:23.474 --> 00:54:26.380
Sitting in the train, you watch a person.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.770
"Ah, this is all right!

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.480
Let's manage this fellow."

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:39.859
All the time you have to catch human beings
like fishes are caught.

00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:44.760
I've taught you how to do it.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.170
To go on catching them, one by one, and create
a greater collectivity.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:55:02.740
If your attention is on that, then I will
say, "You have acted like Buddha", because

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.130
Buddha just did that.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:12.130
From everywhere He collected people, told
them to follow a path of detachment and He

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:17.780
asked them to wear clothes and things which
are for detachment.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:23.510
And He asked that you should detach yourself
from your families, everything.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:30.870
This, all this, He did for one thing, that
they should be prepared for today's life.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:37.430
That they've done all these things, but we
don't want you to wear orange dresses, we

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:45.860
don't want you to do all these wrong things,
which are not needed today.

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:51.380
They were all right in those days, but today
they are wrong because they are not needed.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:57.800
When it is not needed, why should you carry
on your head?

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.960
Like the other day, I saw somebody carrying
a big boat on his head.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.650
I said, "What are you doing?"

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:05.140
He said, "I'm carrying the boat."

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.140
"For what?

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.700
Why are you carrying the boat?"

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:14.800
Said, "You see, I know there is no need to
carry the boat here because there is no sea,

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.320
no water, nothing, but I'm just carrying."

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:24.190
(Laughter) "But why are you carrying this
load upon your head?"

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:30.650
"Ah, because I'm carrying, you know."

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.730
(Laughter)

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:33.810
That is how we are.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:37.849
We are carrying on with things which are not
needed.

00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:42.790
Like, "Mother, now I've been doing Hatha Yoga,
should I do some Hatha Yoga?"

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:46.460
"But why do you want to do it?

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.420
There is no need for you."

00:56:48.219 --> 00:56:53.559
"No, no, Mother, but I've been doing it."

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.260
(Laughter) "So do it now, what to do?"

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:03.820
It's as stupid as this carrying a boat on
your head, that whatever is not needed unnecessarily

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.260
wasting your time.

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:14.150
"I'm used to this, Mother, I used to do this,
so I must do it."

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:18.070
Everything is made very easy for you in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.070
Very simple.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:24.780
You don't have to starve, you don't have to
fast, you don't have to become vegetarians,

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:30.359
you don't have to go and sit in the sun or
meditate on Himalayas.

00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:32.160
Nothing of the kind.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:37.190
Comfortably you can sit down wherever you
like and you can meditate.

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.930
Everything made easy.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:48.150
And once you've found out your Spirit, you
can enjoy everything that's beautiful.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:53.900
Now on the whole, maybe for some people this
is really too much.

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:59.150
In a Sahara Desert you are sitting, everything
blowing on your head.

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:00.150
"What is this?

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.220
How can we live here?

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.660
Such a rough life!"

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:09.530
But you don't feel that way, because you have
the comfort of the Spirit within you.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.930
It's the comfort of the Spirit.

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:19.320
And for the comfort of Spirit you don't need
anything, that's what you have.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:24.050
So do not carry on with nonsensical things.

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.000
Because Buddha went round and round.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.990
As we came today to this program, I was just
thinking like Buddha.

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:35.310
Going from this end, again coming from this
end, then I couldn't find it, then that end,

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:36.310
then coming this way.

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:38.089
Ultimately we reached here, they said it's blocked!

00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:43.429
I said, "Give him a bandhan."

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:45.410
Finished, open!

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:48.500
So this was blocked, that was blocked, go
this way, that way.

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.740
All right, it was blocked for Him.

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.440
So He went round and round.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.080
But it's not blocked for you.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.180
Why do you want to go round and round again?

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.280
But that is what today everybody wants to
do the same way.

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.790
"We must sacrifice, we must give up this,
we must do that."

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.260
What are you going to sacrifice?

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.320
What is there to sacrifice?

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:18.410
I would like to know in Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:26.960
Of course, mostly people sacrifice their brains,
I think.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:34.960
(Laughter) When nothing is to be sacrificed,
why do you want to become a goat of sacrifice?

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:44.089
So from Buddha's life, you don't have to learn
that He went in the jungles and He went, He

00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:47.910
did this and He did also renunciation.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.660
He gave up his wife.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.660
No!

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:59.290
That's not needed now, that's over.

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:06.619
This is where we fail and we cannot explain
to people that those who say, "But we must

01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:07.750
have renunciation."

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:13.590
Renunciation we have from within, like the
sand, as I told you.

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:16.780
Detachment we have from within.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:25.390
But this is compassion, pure compassion is
the most detached thing.

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:36.660
Is the most detached thing is the pure compassion,
or anything pure is pure because it is detached.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.470
It's a proper mathematics.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.910
Anything that is pure has to be detached.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:47.900
If it is attached it is contaminated.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.080
See the logic.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.349
Absolute mathematics is there.

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:56.810
If you have pure love then you are detached.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.300
Now supposing you love Mother - all right,
take that.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:09.520
Now you have say, pure love for Me, then you
won't get angry if I don't come to your house.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.010
You won't feel disappointed if I can't sit
in your car.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:18.790
You won't feel unhappy because I could not
touch your sari.

01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:21.240
Because, "I just love Mother, finished."

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.880
It ends up there.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.520
Just pure love.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:31.490
Of course, I know these weaknesses, so I try
to please you, all right, all right.

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:38.970
But actually, if you really love Me, "It's
all right, I love Her, and She loves me, finished.

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:45.150
Whether She comes to my house or not, whether
She gives me a present or not, whether She

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:51.230
pats me or not, whether I can see Her or not,
whether I can meet Her or not.

01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:53.119
Makes no difference, I love Her."

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.060
That's the purity of love.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:01.670
Where there's no expectation of any kind,
except that I love and that love is the ocean

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:08.420
of enjoyment and the ocean of bliss, finished.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:15.010
Is the easiest thing to do, is to love.

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:19.620
Just love.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:27.660
How your heart increases like an ocean - I
just love.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.130
The sea is not attached to any shore.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:36.590
When it has to come, it comes out, when it
has to go back, it goes back.

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:39.980
When it has to give water for the rain, it
gives.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:46.130
The water goes as the clouds are formed, then
the water falls as rain, again it comes back

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.470
to the sea.

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:51.770
It doesn't stop anywhere.

01:02:51.770 --> 01:03:00.490
In the same way, if we just think, "Is the feeling
I have that I love Mother.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.720
What a feeling it is."

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:10.770
That should be the end of everything, absolutely.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:17.520
I feel the same way; otherwise I would be
feeling every day guilty, "Oh, I didn't smile

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.770
at that, I didn't give a present to this one.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:24.490
I should have brought something special for
that person.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.490
I was late for the program."

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:37.750
(Laughter) But I
don't feel guilty because it's all managed.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:43.450
If I had come earlier, all these hecklers
would have been there to trouble us.

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:46.510
So all the horrible people disappeared and
we had the right people.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:49.660
Then I set down through.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.490
I didn't say, "I'm going back."

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.530
There is no need to be nervous.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:58.420
If Mother is late, there must be some plan.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.540
If She is early, there must be some plan.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:07.290
If She's going by this plane and not by the
other, there must be some plan.

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.339
Not to doubt it.

01:04:09.339 --> 01:04:11.960
If She's doing something, must be some plan.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.030
You know, Mother has Her own plans.

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:18.250
Is a nice idea to think like that.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:22.800
"She has Her own plans, you know."

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:30.990
Once you start feeling that way, such security
and such beautiful peace will spread in your

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.990
being.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.359
And you will be quite satisfied.

01:04:34.359 --> 01:04:38.480
Now, everybody brings food for Me, look at
that.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.750
I mean, when I see that I get a fright, baba.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:49.980
(Laughter) I mean, look at that!

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:57.590
I'm supposed to taste it, but even tasting
will be so much.

01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:06.230
(Laughter) But I've to eat, you know, because
if I don't touch one of them, then they will

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:07.710
think, "Why didn't Mother touch?

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:08.710
Must be something wrong."

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:21.030
(Laughter) This is a very big problem for
Me, to keep you happy and to assure you.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:24.970
But I assure you that I love you all very
much!!

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:30.119
Whether you bring food for Me, or flowers
for Me or anything.

01:05:30.119 --> 01:05:32.160
Does not matter.

01:05:31.959 --> 01:05:39.388
When I'm leaving Bogota, My heart is wrenching
out, I've seen the wrench of My heart, I've

01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:40.589
seen.

01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:44.510
Because I'm leaving all the new babes there,
that's all.

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:51.279
Then I just don't want to face, I mean, the
thing, I feel, "Oh God, just see I'm leaving

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.480
them."

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.510
But, because I love them.

01:05:56.309 --> 01:06:04.599
So I see, because I love them I feel it, so
it's all right, even this pain is all right, because

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.550
I love them.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:11.200
I enjoy that pain because I love them.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.970
And then I come here and see all of you standing
at the airport.

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:17.720
Whole thing is fulfilled again.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:26.520
Just not because you have come - because I
have come to love you.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:32.440
All this is such a beautiful rapport and such
a beautiful feeling.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:39.240
I want you all to enjoy this and not petty
things and small things which spoil your joy.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:46.020
These are all joy killers and that's why the
greatest joy killer is the ego nonsensical,

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:50.839
which tells you, "Oh, why didn't Mother do
this or do that?"

01:06:50.839 --> 01:06:53.000
It's the ego part of it.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.380
That's why we have to think of Buddha and
celebrate his Jayanti within ourselves to

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:07.870
establish Him to say that, "This ego cannot
take away our joy."

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:13.580
Anywhere such idea just comes into your head
tell them, "Now Mister ego, I know you very

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.580
well!"

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:20.720
(Laughter) In the light of Buddha you can
see your ego very clearly.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.619
And He's the killer of your ego, He's the
one who finishes off your ego.

01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:33.480
So today we have to pray for the whole of
America which is really suffering from this

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.050
nonsensical, mythical ego, which is being
exploited by everyone.

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:43.329
People are befooling them, the media is befooling,
all the doctors are befooling, all the psychologists

01:07:43.329 --> 01:07:47.470
are befooling, all the governments are befooling.

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:51.630
I mean, I don't know, everybody is befooled,
because they've got ego.

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.220
If they had no ego, they could not have been
befooled.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:08:02.450
All these advertisements and all this hocus-pocus
that's going on, is because human beings have

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:06.609
ego and they can't see it.

01:08:06.609 --> 01:08:14.910
So we have to say, "Mother, please take away
this curse of ego from Americans and America."

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:20.230
That's why it is nice today we have this Buddha
Puja.

01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.279
May God bless you!
