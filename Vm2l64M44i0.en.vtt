00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:11.268
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:17.588
It is said about him, that

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:24.188
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:32.468
by Adi Shakti.

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:37.028
And about his creation, you know the story.

00:00:37.228 --> 00:00:42.108
And also you know

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:47.628
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:55.948
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:04.828
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:09.308
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:17.308
with the vibrations of his Mother.

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:23.548
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:26.988
we have never understood.

00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:31.028
Now look at the Mother Earth,

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:38.188
She is the one who produces all kinds of

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:43.348
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:50.508
of different nature, color, heights.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:53.908
The trees are different.

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:58.948
Trees, when they grow up,

00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:04.388
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:10.668
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:14.388
Look at the collective sense

00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:19.628
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:24.708
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:30.508
which is giving us everything that we want

00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:34.268
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:37.988
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:43.828
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:49.068
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:52.748
and half of it is seen.

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:59.508
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:03.468
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:10.708
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:16.188
and what does She do within us,

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:21.188
to build us up in which way?

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:25.828
So it is the primordial power

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.788
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

00:03:29.988 --> 00:03:34.228
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:38.308
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:40.828
and another miraculous thing is

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:44.468
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:46.908
and a coconut will never fall

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:51.508
on any creature or any human being.

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:54.188
That means it´s all thinking,

00:03:54.388 --> 00:03:57.068
all understanding, all consciousness,

00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:01.388
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

00:04:01.588 --> 00:04:04.588
But we never understand.

00:04:04.788 --> 00:04:08.428
As it is we take it for granted.

00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:15.388
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:19.868
She´s the primordial power.

00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:25.668
What she does is to build in us a primordial

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:28.468
– what we can call – restrictions

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:33.588
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:40.908
For example, you see the steel is here.

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:43.268
It has its own dharma,

00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:46.868
it cannot behave like wood.

00:04:47.068 --> 00:04:49.348
Wood has its own dharma,

00:04:49.548 --> 00:04:55.388
it cannot behave like silver.

00:04:55.588 --> 00:05:03.028
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:08.988
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

00:05:09.188 --> 00:05:11.948
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

00:05:12.148 --> 00:05:17.188
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:21.668
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:26.668
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.148
Once in Prathisthan,

00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:32.988
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:37.628
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:39.988
Of course I was quite away from it,

00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:43.468
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:47.108
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:51.628
So somebody went down and killed it

00:05:52.108 --> 00:05:54.188
and brought his body up there.

00:05:54.388 --> 00:05:58.668
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:05.508
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

00:06:05.988 --> 00:06:09.428
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:14.948
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:20.068
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

00:06:20.268 --> 00:06:22.468
so what should we do?

00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:25.028
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:29.148
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:36.388
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

00:06:36.548 --> 00:06:38.668
They said “there must be a female”,

00:06:38.868 --> 00:06:41.188
and she was searching for him

00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:44.028
when suddenly somebody saw her.

00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:48.308
They killed her also, they killed her

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:51.988
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:53.508
I was amazed,

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:55.428
very beautiful pattern

00:06:55.628 --> 00:06:59.388
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:03.708
Exactly the same, she also made.

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:05.788
So I was surprised

00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:10.508
how is it that this lady knows how

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.828
to copy her husband?

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:15.948
She did it, and when we burnt her,

00:07:16.148 --> 00:07:19.508
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

00:07:19.908 --> 00:07:24.148
But what I felt is that animals,

00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:28.588
creepers, those who creep permanently,

00:07:28.788 --> 00:07:32.988
other people also, every type of animal,

00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:38.788
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

00:07:38.988 --> 00:07:44.788
that every type of animal has the exact,

00:07:44.988 --> 00:07:48.988
the same sample of behavior.

00:07:51.228 --> 00:07:54.508
For example, you can put the dog in the water

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:58.188
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:03.428
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:08.668
what I call the primordial taboos.

00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:13.628
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:18.428
built within us, which are dharma.

00:08:19.468 --> 00:08:22.868
A human being has to be like that.

00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:25.828
If he tries to be something else

00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:28.788
something goes wrong with his life.

00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:32.588
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

00:08:32.788 --> 00:08:36.988
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:40.548
In the same way when human beings

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:44.588
start deviating from the line of dharma,

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:46.988
they get into trouble.

00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:50.708
But it is only human beings who can do that.

00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:55.468
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:59.148
and can become horrible.

00:08:59.388 --> 00:09:01.548
You see a person,

00:09:01.748 --> 00:09:05.628
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:11.468
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:16.948
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

00:09:17.148 --> 00:09:20.108
For a man it is primordial that he should have

00:09:20.308 --> 00:09:25.908
only one wife, and she, one husband.

00:09:26.628 --> 00:09:30.748
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

00:09:30.948 --> 00:09:33.548
something goes wrong.

00:09:34.268 --> 00:09:38.468
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:45.348
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

00:09:48.828 --> 00:09:54.428
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:59.748
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

00:09:59.948 --> 00:10:03.748
now you want to break it, you can break it

00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:06.548
because you are human beings,

00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:09.068
but it will be broken.

00:10:09.268 --> 00:10:10.948
As simple as that,

00:10:11.148 --> 00:10:14.628
we have to understand we are human beings

00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:17.028
and we cannot do things

00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:21.548
which go against our dharma.

00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:24.388
Now why the dharma?

00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:29.468
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:36.188
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

00:10:36.388 --> 00:10:41.028
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:44.668
Especially in the west, this is very common.

00:10:44.868 --> 00:10:48.308
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

00:10:48.508 --> 00:10:50.868
or people who are,

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:54.468
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

00:10:54.668 --> 00:10:58.628
But those people who were made aware

00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:03.348
of their primordial taboos somehow.

00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:08.708
As the animals know what is bad for them

00:11:09.508 --> 00:11:17.748
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:22.748
Today we are here with Australians,

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:28.308
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

00:11:28.508 --> 00:11:33.628
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

00:11:33.828 --> 00:11:39.748
So might be they might have got it from India,

00:11:39.948 --> 00:11:43.308
or maybe they have gone there from India.

00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:48.188
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

00:11:48.748 --> 00:11:53.948
So I started thinking about them.

00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:58.468
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

00:11:58.668 --> 00:12:03.988
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:08.988
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:11.548
Gaynabai was her name,

00:12:11.748 --> 00:12:13.668
she was an excellent cook,

00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:17.828
but she had her maryadas.

00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:21.428
All the time, like if my father came

00:12:21.628 --> 00:12:23.988
she would immediately cover her head

00:12:24.188 --> 00:12:27.348
and go in the other room, to respect him.

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:30.988
Nobody told her to do that.

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:40.068
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

00:12:40.348 --> 00:12:43.548
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

00:12:43.748 --> 00:12:48.188
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

00:12:48.388 --> 00:12:51.508
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:53.668
where I used to meet them

00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:56.748
and I was surprised, they would not drink

00:12:56.948 --> 00:13:02.628
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.628
They would not drink,

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:10.348
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:15.988
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

00:13:16.188 --> 00:13:19.268
They would never steal anything,

00:13:19.468 --> 00:13:22.188
and I was really very impressed,

00:13:22.428 --> 00:13:25.308
how these people were so dharmic,

00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:27.748
so good and happy.

00:13:27.948 --> 00:13:30.748
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

00:13:30.948 --> 00:13:35.148
but they were very clean and neat people.

00:13:37.428 --> 00:13:41.108
It is now changed.

00:13:41.468 --> 00:13:45.428
The same people have changed so much.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:58.348
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:02.348
They worship Mother,

00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:06.668
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

00:14:07.028 --> 00:14:10.668
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:13.268
She said “she gives us everything.

00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:15.668
She is a just Mother,

00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:19.268
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

00:14:19.468 --> 00:14:24.508
and she is the most conscious person,

00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:29.228
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:37.708
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:41.668
they used to think about it.

00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:44.548
But then the missionaries came,

00:14:44.748 --> 00:14:47.068
they converted them,

00:14:47.268 --> 00:14:48.988
they gave them skirts and blouses

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.348
and I don´t know what all they did.

00:14:51.548 --> 00:14:53.148
But Gaynabai did not take,

00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:55.228
she said “what is this?”

00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:57.588
Why should I wear a dress like this

00:14:57.788 --> 00:15:00.108
where the whole body is exposed?

00:15:00.308 --> 00:15:03.868
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:07.828
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:14.948
But when they met with these so called advanced people

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:19.628
so many of them started living like that.

00:15:21.428 --> 00:15:23.348
They said “you have no freedom;

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.108
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

00:15:27.308 --> 00:15:32.268
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

00:15:32.468 --> 00:15:36.628
by the divine understanding

00:15:36.828 --> 00:15:40.388
and then they started changing.

00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:43.428
She was alright, her husband was alright

00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:45.868
but her son started drinking,

00:15:46.068 --> 00:15:47.948
this is the beginning of the end,

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:53.188
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:59.188
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:04.548
and the idea was only that “we are free,

00:16:04.748 --> 00:16:07.188
what´s wrong?”

00:16:10.188 --> 00:16:12.548
Now these primordial taboos

00:16:12.748 --> 00:16:17.468
are in you, built in. They are there.

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:24.548
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:26.508
maybe you have curbed them down,

00:16:26.708 --> 00:16:30.388
maybe you have turned them out,

00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:33.388
but they are there.

00:16:33.588 --> 00:16:36.708
All the time they are there,

00:16:37.428 --> 00:16:42.388
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:47.628
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:53.068
So when Mother created this universe,

00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:58.508
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

00:17:00.108 --> 00:17:03.348
Auspiciousness was created.

00:17:03.548 --> 00:17:07.548
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:15.228
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

00:17:15.428 --> 00:17:27.428
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

00:17:29.668 --> 00:17:33.708
For example, in India we all used to do that,

00:17:33.908 --> 00:17:37.428
though I was in a Christian family,

00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:39.988
that before touching the Mother Earth,

00:17:40.188 --> 00:17:42.268
getting up from the bed,

00:17:42.468 --> 00:17:45.548
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:49.868
because we are touching you with our feet”.

00:17:52.388 --> 00:17:56.668
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.508
is built in within us,

00:17:58.708 --> 00:18:03.268
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

00:18:03.468 --> 00:18:08.188
we can call it whole universe.

00:18:08.628 --> 00:18:15.628
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

00:18:15.988 --> 00:18:20.748
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

00:18:21.228 --> 00:18:25.308
your gravity itself reduces.

00:18:27.188 --> 00:18:31.828
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:34.948
while we are plundering everything,

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:38.108
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

00:18:38.308 --> 00:18:42.228
Whatever is outside is also inside.

00:18:42.428 --> 00:18:47.708
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

00:18:47.908 --> 00:18:52.108
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:56.588
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

00:18:57.628 --> 00:19:05.708
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

00:19:05.908 --> 00:19:17.468
is that we are paying more attention to money.

00:19:19.388 --> 00:19:23.828
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:27.588
then it is hurting the Mother.

00:19:27.788 --> 00:19:31.468
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

00:19:31.668 --> 00:19:33.668
then she´s happy.

00:19:33.868 --> 00:19:37.148
Her discretion is so great,

00:19:37.348 --> 00:19:41.508
see the way she produces flowers.

00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:44.308
Different, different types of flowers.

00:19:44.508 --> 00:19:48.748
In different countries, different types of flowers.

00:19:49.028 --> 00:19:51.388
Like I saw in my country

00:19:51.588 --> 00:19:55.148
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:58.068
very fragrant.

00:19:58.268 --> 00:20:05.308
And she understands so much.

00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:08.828
Once I went to Australia

00:20:09.188 --> 00:20:12.828
and this flower you call hibiscus,

00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:18.588
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

00:20:18.788 --> 00:20:21.628
imagine it becomes first pink

00:20:21.828 --> 00:20:24.548
and then gradually it becomes red.

00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:29.628
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:32.428
Now how can you say there is no connection

00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:36.628
between a sunflower and the sun?

00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:40.748
Automatically it goes on changing.

00:20:41.388 --> 00:20:46.148
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

00:20:46.348 --> 00:20:50.268
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:54.628
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

00:20:54.828 --> 00:21:01.188
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

00:21:01.748 --> 00:21:04.988
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

00:21:05.188 --> 00:21:09.828
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

00:21:10.028 --> 00:21:16.148
I went and when I arrived in the hall

00:21:16.348 --> 00:21:21.588
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

00:21:22.268 --> 00:21:24.708
I never talked to them, just on their own.

00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:27.988
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

00:21:28.188 --> 00:21:32.828
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

00:21:33.908 --> 00:21:39.108
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

00:21:40.548 --> 00:21:42.788
It´s very remarkable

00:21:42.988 --> 00:21:47.028
how the nature is so much within us

00:21:47.188 --> 00:21:50.708
and how this, whatever it is within us,

00:21:50.908 --> 00:21:56.468
guides outside and receives the blessings.

00:21:56.628 --> 00:21:59.388
We are not something separate.

00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:02.828
This Mother Earth is our home,

00:22:03.028 --> 00:22:08.948
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:13.308
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

00:22:13.508 --> 00:22:16.028
He had a body of the clay,

00:22:16.188 --> 00:22:18.388
just ordinary clay.

00:22:19.348 --> 00:22:21.148
So you can imagine,

00:22:21.348 --> 00:22:23.428
if you can really think of it,

00:22:23.628 --> 00:22:29.628
how this whole universe has created us;

00:22:31.628 --> 00:22:34.588
all of it is within us

00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:38.588
and when we try to hurt something,

00:22:40.268 --> 00:22:44.668
then we are hurting ourselves.

00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:50.828
The intelligence of Mother Earth

00:22:51.028 --> 00:22:54.348
I have seen from my childhood.

00:22:55.788 --> 00:23:01.028
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:02.548
and the Mother Earth

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:06.068
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

00:23:06.268 --> 00:23:09.628
used to go and live in the forest.

00:23:09.828 --> 00:23:13.908
Only in the forest you could see clearly

00:23:14.108 --> 00:23:23.148
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

00:23:23.348 --> 00:23:27.948
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

00:23:28.788 --> 00:23:31.508
For us it is difficult,

00:23:31.708 --> 00:23:37.228
we are rather, “free” people.

00:23:39.348 --> 00:23:46.068
So simple things, simple things like a woman

00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:51.908
should be always covered properly in her body.

00:23:52.108 --> 00:23:54.508
Because she respects her body,

00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:57.188
she respects her chastity.

00:23:57.388 --> 00:23:59.948
But if you tell this to somebody

00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:02.188
they won´t listen.

00:24:02.388 --> 00:24:07.148
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

00:24:08.468 --> 00:24:10.788
no leaf falls off.

00:24:10.988 --> 00:24:14.828
I call them as the females,

00:24:15.028 --> 00:24:18.188
and the other trees, deciduous,

00:24:18.388 --> 00:24:24.228
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

00:24:24.428 --> 00:24:27.268
Because they are men.

00:24:27.468 --> 00:24:29.868
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:31.748
If I used to go to any party

00:24:31.948 --> 00:24:35.428
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

00:24:35.628 --> 00:24:37.268
you meet someone, immediately

00:24:37.468 --> 00:24:40.348
the man will button up himself

00:24:40.548 --> 00:24:43.348
and the women will open themselves.

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:47.388
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

00:24:47.588 --> 00:24:50.188
and this one has gone this side.

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:53.068
It´s so stupid.

00:24:53.268 --> 00:24:56.668
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

00:24:56.868 --> 00:25:02.628
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:07.068
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

00:25:10.588 --> 00:25:14.068
So this craze of exposure of the body

00:25:14.268 --> 00:25:18.908
has become so strong now that even in India,

00:25:19.108 --> 00:25:21.748
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

00:25:21.948 --> 00:25:24.628
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:27.548
really this never happens in India.

00:25:27.748 --> 00:25:30.188
What you see in the films, never happens!

00:25:30.388 --> 00:25:32.308
If they start wearing dresses like that

00:25:32.508 --> 00:25:36.348
so many people will throw stones at them.

00:25:38.588 --> 00:25:42.628
Then all other sorts of,

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:47.908
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

00:25:48.108 --> 00:25:53.548
things happened, like, I can´t understand

00:25:53.748 --> 00:25:58.908
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

00:25:59.108 --> 00:26:03.068
and children, and this and that and that.

00:26:04.508 --> 00:26:08.188
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

00:26:08.428 --> 00:26:11.188
Why? Why has it happened here?

00:26:11.388 --> 00:26:14.788
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

00:26:14.988 --> 00:26:17.668
also in these countries.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:22.348
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:26.388
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

00:26:26.548 --> 00:26:30.868
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

00:26:31.068 --> 00:26:32.548
or something horrible,

00:26:32.748 --> 00:26:36.548
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

00:26:36.748 --> 00:26:39.628
Absurd!

00:26:41.268 --> 00:26:46.148
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

00:26:46.348 --> 00:26:52.828
and unmarried men are having relations.

00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:56.468
All kinds of things people do.

00:26:56.668 --> 00:27:01.148
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

00:27:01.348 --> 00:27:06.548
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

00:27:06.748 --> 00:27:12.028
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

00:27:12.188 --> 00:27:14.708
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

00:27:14.908 --> 00:27:18.268
yes because they take bath in the river.

00:27:18.468 --> 00:27:23.068
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:26.188
I was a medical student, I have studied,

00:27:26.388 --> 00:27:28.788
I came from a very open family,

00:27:28.988 --> 00:27:30.948
I never knew these things,

00:27:31.148 --> 00:27:35.308
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

00:27:37.148 --> 00:27:39.828
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

00:27:40.028 --> 00:27:42.668
we have never heard of such reports.

00:27:42.868 --> 00:27:46.148
This is absurd!!

00:27:52.988 --> 00:27:55.668
You see the children.

00:27:55.868 --> 00:27:58.988
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

00:27:59.188 --> 00:28:00.748
who was feeling shy,

00:28:00.948 --> 00:28:04.748
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

00:28:05.228 --> 00:28:12.788
Shyness is the ornament of women.

00:28:13.228 --> 00:28:16.308
Children are all shy.

00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:18.788
I remember my granddaughter

00:28:18.988 --> 00:28:23.188
she was once watching one magazine,

00:28:23.428 --> 00:28:26.668
she was very small, two years or so.

00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:31.348
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

00:28:31.548 --> 00:28:33.668
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

00:28:33.868 --> 00:28:35.188
She saw in the magazine.

00:28:35.428 --> 00:28:37.988
My grandmother will come

00:28:38.188 --> 00:28:40.508
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

00:28:40.708 --> 00:28:42.548
Please wear your dresses”.

00:28:42.748 --> 00:28:47.148
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

00:28:47.348 --> 00:28:50.148
I don´t know if they are advanced,

00:28:50.348 --> 00:28:55.308
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

00:28:55.628 --> 00:28:58.468
But the shamelessness has gone,

00:28:58.668 --> 00:29:01.108
to such an extent

00:29:01.308 --> 00:29:06.988
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:16.348
This is nothing.

00:29:17.628 --> 00:29:21.948
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

00:29:22.148 --> 00:29:24.668
but they were so much,

00:29:24.868 --> 00:29:30.628
so much impressed by the white skin,

00:29:30.828 --> 00:29:33.028
that they accepted everything.

00:29:33.228 --> 00:29:35.348
But they were even having relations

00:29:35.548 --> 00:29:39.388
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:42.388
Competition.

00:29:44.628 --> 00:29:47.108
These are the subjects,

00:29:47.308 --> 00:29:50.148
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

00:29:50.348 --> 00:29:53.908
and I can´t understand

00:29:54.108 --> 00:29:58.668
how can a human being go to that level.

00:29:59.388 --> 00:30:05.428
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:08.068 --> 00:30:11.548
where you have become aware, aware

00:30:11.748 --> 00:30:15.828
of your natural taboos.

00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:19.028
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

00:30:19.188 --> 00:30:23.508
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:26.828
I never expected so much, I tell you,

00:30:27.028 --> 00:30:30.588
but you have accepted it,

00:30:31.348 --> 00:30:34.228
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

00:30:34.428 --> 00:30:37.108
your practicing it.

00:30:38.788 --> 00:30:43.028
You see the lives of all the great saints.

00:30:45.788 --> 00:30:49.708
You can´t have something, like Diana,

00:30:49.908 --> 00:30:51.828
see, they are going to call her a saint.

00:30:52.028 --> 00:30:54.868
She had no maryadas.

00:30:55.508 --> 00:30:57.268
Oh I have sympathies with her because

00:30:57.468 --> 00:31:00.068
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

00:31:00.268 --> 00:31:04.428
but maryadas are very important.

00:31:05.028 --> 00:31:07.748
How can she be a saint?

00:31:07.948 --> 00:31:13.388
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

00:31:13.588 --> 00:31:18.948
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

00:31:19.828 --> 00:31:23.148
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:26.388
I mean that´s what he was,

00:31:26.588 --> 00:31:28.548
he was born like that,

00:31:28.748 --> 00:31:33.068
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:36.428
Also the other way round is that,

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:40.428
now the majority is the law.

00:31:40.628 --> 00:31:43.508
If the majority is stupid,

00:31:43.708 --> 00:31:49.108
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

00:31:49.828 --> 00:31:54.908
They have no brains they have no intelligence

00:31:55.108 --> 00:31:58.588
to understand how can these things help;

00:31:58.788 --> 00:32:01.548
alcohol for example.

00:32:01.748 --> 00:32:07.268
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

00:32:08.068 --> 00:32:14.108
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:15.868
They won´t talk to you they say that

00:32:16.068 --> 00:32:19.948
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

00:32:22.548 --> 00:32:24.468
And it is so rampant,

00:32:24.668 --> 00:32:28.508
it is so much in the society

00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:31.108
that all the parties I attended,

00:32:31.308 --> 00:32:35.108
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

00:32:35.308 --> 00:32:40.628
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

00:32:42.068 --> 00:32:44.268
They are all poisons,

00:32:44.468 --> 00:32:46.948
these are all poisons

00:32:47.108 --> 00:32:53.548
spoiling us completely from one to another.

00:32:53.748 --> 00:33:00.868
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

00:33:01.068 --> 00:33:04.908
imagine – why to smoke?

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:09.348
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

00:33:09.548 --> 00:33:14.188
But they have no courage to give it up now.

00:33:14.388 --> 00:33:17.428
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:23.948
When will they start “no alcohol?”

00:33:25.828 --> 00:33:31.148
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

00:33:31.348 --> 00:33:34.868
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

00:33:35.068 --> 00:33:36.668
You see people falling down,

00:33:36.868 --> 00:33:41.348
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

00:33:41.548 --> 00:33:45.068
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

00:33:45.268 --> 00:33:49.388
all this shamelessness will go away.

00:33:50.068 --> 00:33:54.148
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

00:33:54.348 --> 00:33:55.988
One alcoholic told me

00:33:56.188 --> 00:34:01.548
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:05.388
but see her as my beloved”.

00:34:05.588 --> 00:34:09.428
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

00:34:09.748 --> 00:34:15.988
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

00:34:16.628 --> 00:34:19.148
Now, we don´t even understand how

00:34:19.348 --> 00:34:25.908
our primordial taboos are completely battered

00:34:26.108 --> 00:34:29.748
by the society here.

00:34:31.588 --> 00:34:37.348
The simple thing is that

00:34:44.948 --> 00:34:52.188
to understand your own self,

00:34:52.388 --> 00:34:56.508
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

00:34:56.708 --> 00:35:00.868
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

00:35:01.028 --> 00:35:04.268
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

00:35:04.468 --> 00:35:06.948
what are they doing?

00:35:07.148 --> 00:35:11.588
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

00:35:12.868 --> 00:35:18.228
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

00:35:18.428 --> 00:35:21.588
They talk in a very special manner,

00:35:21.788 --> 00:35:25.908
move themselves in a very,

00:35:27.988 --> 00:35:33.268
I should say, like a trained personality

00:35:33.468 --> 00:35:41.268
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

00:35:41.908 --> 00:35:46.908
They think that He lacks eliteness.

00:35:48.468 --> 00:35:55.028
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

00:35:57.668 --> 00:36:00.988
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

00:36:02.988 --> 00:36:08.268
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

00:36:08.948 --> 00:36:13.668
He eats like a glutton

00:36:18.588 --> 00:36:23.748
and He looks at you

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:31.188
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

00:36:34.988 --> 00:36:42.268
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

00:36:42.468 --> 00:36:48.828
when he became Christ there He developed,

00:36:49.348 --> 00:36:52.948
I don´t know how it worked out,

00:36:53.148 --> 00:37:02.988
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

00:37:04.148 --> 00:37:07.308
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

00:37:07.508 --> 00:37:10.268
He´ll never forgive,

00:37:10.468 --> 00:37:13.068
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

00:37:13.268 --> 00:37:16.468
“No, that I´ll not do”.

00:37:18.628 --> 00:37:20.788
He never forgives!!

00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:24.828
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

00:37:25.028 --> 00:37:27.948
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

00:37:28.148 --> 00:37:29.868
because one thing about Him is,

00:37:30.068 --> 00:37:34.268
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

00:37:34.468 --> 00:37:36.628
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

00:37:36.828 --> 00:37:41.428
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

00:37:41.628 --> 00:37:49.148
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:53.148
Thousands of them.

00:37:53.348 --> 00:38:00.188
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

00:38:00.388 --> 00:38:07.628
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

00:38:09.748 --> 00:38:15.868
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

00:38:16.068 --> 00:38:18.668
from these secret diseases,

00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:25.148
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:29.428
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

00:38:29.628 --> 00:38:35.868
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:39.788
They too have their own dharma.

00:38:40.188 --> 00:38:43.188
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

00:38:43.428 --> 00:38:47.548
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

00:38:47.748 --> 00:38:52.188
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

00:38:52.388 --> 00:38:56.748
then he´s a very difficult man.

00:38:58.908 --> 00:39:02.108
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

00:39:02.308 --> 00:39:05.828
but the nature takes respite.

00:39:09.348 --> 00:39:15.868
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

00:39:16.468 --> 00:39:20.148
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

00:39:20.348 --> 00:39:23.548
is very, very difficult.

00:39:23.788 --> 00:39:28.468
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

00:39:28.668 --> 00:39:35.588
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

00:39:36.068 --> 00:39:39.948
He´s a child, alright,

00:39:40.668 --> 00:39:46.228
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

00:39:46.868 --> 00:39:52.948
despite all that He cannot forgive you

00:39:53.148 --> 00:39:57.268
if you disturb your innocence.

00:39:58.908 --> 00:40:01.548
Mother is just the opposite,

00:40:01.748 --> 00:40:05.628
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

00:40:06.548 --> 00:40:09.308
But not Ganesha,

00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:13.388
Ganesha says “alright,

00:40:16.188 --> 00:40:19.908
you better go to hell”

00:40:20.108 --> 00:40:23.068
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

00:40:23.268 --> 00:40:26.308
those people who like drinking, smoking,

00:40:26.508 --> 00:40:29.388
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

00:40:29.588 --> 00:40:32.668
What else is hell?

00:40:33.028 --> 00:40:40.308
And he will never save you from hell.

00:40:47.108 --> 00:40:52.548
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

00:40:52.748 --> 00:40:55.588
they say that at the time

00:40:55.788 --> 00:41:00.028
when I am getting my realization

00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:04.308
you must save me.

00:41:04.508 --> 00:41:07.828
That´s the only thing they ask,

00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:14.228
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

00:41:14.428 --> 00:41:16.548
It does not say that

00:41:16.748 --> 00:41:20.748
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

00:41:20.948 --> 00:41:23.588
You save me.

00:41:24.948 --> 00:41:31.308
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

00:41:31.508 --> 00:41:36.108
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

00:41:37.588 --> 00:41:40.948
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

00:41:41.148 --> 00:41:43.668
Mahadeva on your side,

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:47.668
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

00:41:47.868 --> 00:41:52.428
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

00:41:52.628 --> 00:41:57.948
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

00:41:58.388 --> 00:42:03.548
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

00:42:03.748 --> 00:42:05.788
In these modern times

00:42:05.988 --> 00:42:09.788
horrible things are happening to children.

00:42:09.988 --> 00:42:15.788
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

00:42:15.988 --> 00:42:19.388
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

00:42:19.588 --> 00:42:21.548
they teach them bad things.

00:42:21.748 --> 00:42:26.548
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

00:42:27.388 --> 00:42:29.908
So then we have to be careful.

00:42:30.108 --> 00:42:35.148
We have to be very very careful about our children.

00:42:35.348 --> 00:42:37.988
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:44.588
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

00:42:44.788 --> 00:42:55.628
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

00:42:55.988 --> 00:43:01.108
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

00:43:01.308 --> 00:43:03.628
I´m not worried about a child

00:43:03.828 --> 00:43:06.228
being little bit, what you can call,

00:43:06.428 --> 00:43:12.108
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

00:43:12.308 --> 00:43:13.708
It´s alright.

00:43:13.908 --> 00:43:21.868
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

00:43:23.428 --> 00:43:27.668
All kinds of diseases can develop,

00:43:28.148 --> 00:43:33.028
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

00:43:33.188 --> 00:43:36.188
then they are very difficult to revive.

00:43:36.428 --> 00:43:40.588
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

00:43:40.788 --> 00:43:44.108
only there are some clouds

00:43:44.308 --> 00:43:48.308
which try to cover innocence

00:43:48.508 --> 00:43:53.828
and we become rather ignorant about it,

00:43:54.388 --> 00:43:58.708
that we have done anything wrong.

00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:02.668
That is your duty.

00:44:03.468 --> 00:44:06.708
Your society is horrible.

00:44:06.908 --> 00:44:10.508
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

00:44:10.708 --> 00:44:14.468
When I think about it I really get a fright.

00:44:20.228 --> 00:44:23.388
The solution is that you have to be

00:44:23.548 --> 00:44:28.948
careful about your children and their thinking

00:44:29.148 --> 00:44:36.428
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:43.388
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

00:44:43.588 --> 00:44:47.868
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

00:44:48.068 --> 00:44:52.748
and he´s always there to protect your children,

00:44:52.948 --> 00:44:57.548
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

00:44:57.788 --> 00:45:04.388
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

00:45:04.548 --> 00:45:11.788
because if you have to cross this margin

00:45:11.948 --> 00:45:16.588
of human life and spiritual life,

00:45:16.788 --> 00:45:21.508
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

00:45:24.068 --> 00:45:28.868
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

00:45:29.068 --> 00:45:33.588
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

00:45:35.348 --> 00:45:39.668
He´s the one who also suggests to you

00:45:39.868 --> 00:45:44.068
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

00:45:46.628 --> 00:45:52.748
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

00:45:52.948 --> 00:45:57.348
It is not so difficult.

00:45:58.148 --> 00:45:59.948
The way people talk

00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:03.788
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

00:46:03.988 --> 00:46:08.268
even the animals don't talk like that.

00:46:08.468 --> 00:46:14.508
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

00:46:14.708 --> 00:46:20.868
For example flowers, nature, garden.

00:46:21.068 --> 00:46:24.708
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

00:46:24.908 --> 00:46:30.068
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

00:46:30.268 --> 00:46:35.108
or a beautiful place.

00:46:35.308 --> 00:46:37.828
Every time I am here

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:42.188
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

00:46:42.388 --> 00:46:47.388
which is very barren, how can I change it.

00:46:47.588 --> 00:46:50.748
All the time there is thought

00:46:50.948 --> 00:46:56.988
about how to make it beautiful,

00:47:00.188 --> 00:47:03.948
and in that, if there is innocence,

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:05.988
no greed,

00:47:06.188 --> 00:47:09.748
there is no competition,

00:47:09.948 --> 00:47:11.828
there is no attachment,

00:47:12.028 --> 00:47:14.988
but just to enjoy the beauty

00:47:15.188 --> 00:47:20.748
of your own creation, to see how things are.

00:47:23.308 --> 00:47:26.348
Out of proportion people have gone,

00:47:26.548 --> 00:47:29.588
out of understanding.

00:47:29.788 --> 00:47:33.148
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

00:47:33.348 --> 00:47:38.228
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

00:47:38.428 --> 00:47:41.708
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

00:47:41.908 --> 00:47:43.668
If you have so many fruits

00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:50.188
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

00:47:50.628 --> 00:47:56.108
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

00:47:57.108 --> 00:48:06.148
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

00:48:06.828 --> 00:48:12.788
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

00:48:12.988 --> 00:48:16.588
just to keep the prices high.

00:48:16.788 --> 00:48:19.588
Very cruel!

00:48:19.788 --> 00:48:22.668
They are very cruel still.

00:48:22.868 --> 00:48:27.988
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

00:48:28.228 --> 00:48:30.988
All this happens.

00:48:31.868 --> 00:48:36.988
So it´s still happening

00:48:37.188 --> 00:48:43.188
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

00:48:46.028 --> 00:48:53.708
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

00:48:54.308 --> 00:49:01.468
Then the way they glorify drinking

00:49:01.668 --> 00:49:04.668
is the best part of it.

00:49:04.868 --> 00:49:09.708
It´s all done, you see it.

00:49:10.148 --> 00:49:13.988
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

00:49:14.188 --> 00:49:19.628
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

00:49:20.068 --> 00:49:25.988
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

00:49:26.188 --> 00:49:28.108
I personally think

00:49:28.308 --> 00:49:36.228
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

00:49:36.588 --> 00:49:42.068
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

00:49:42.268 --> 00:49:45.468
why should he do such things?

00:49:45.668 --> 00:49:50.348
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

00:49:51.828 --> 00:49:55.348
It´s impossible to understand

00:49:55.548 --> 00:50:00.108
how can a normal person do such a thing.

00:50:00.308 --> 00:50:03.348
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

00:50:03.548 --> 00:50:07.948
he keeps you on the proper track.

00:50:08.148 --> 00:50:10.828
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

00:50:11.028 --> 00:50:13.828
you are thrown away.

00:50:20.348 --> 00:50:26.308
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

00:50:26.508 --> 00:50:28.468
with Shri Ganesha

00:50:28.668 --> 00:50:35.428
and with our Kundalini is like,

00:50:35.628 --> 00:50:43.748
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

00:50:45.028 --> 00:50:47.468
If you start loving the nature

00:50:47.668 --> 00:50:53.788
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

00:50:55.708 --> 00:50:59.468
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

00:50:59.668 --> 00:51:04.548
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:04.748 --> 00:51:08.548
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

00:51:08.748 --> 00:51:11.748
and I don´t want to have any such position

00:51:11.948 --> 00:51:14.908
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

00:51:15.108 --> 00:51:17.468
And I was a very good sportswoman.

00:51:17.668 --> 00:51:22.428
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

00:51:22.628 --> 00:51:26.588
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

00:51:26.788 --> 00:51:29.908
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

00:51:30.108 --> 00:51:31.748
I studied medicine

00:51:31.948 --> 00:51:36.428
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

00:51:37.388 --> 00:51:44.428
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

00:51:44.628 --> 00:51:48.388
and I have to do the job

00:51:48.588 --> 00:51:53.348
of awakening the primordial nature,

00:51:53.548 --> 00:51:55.908
the dharma within human beings,

00:51:56.108 --> 00:51:59.468
and that´s what I have to do

00:52:00.468 --> 00:52:03.388
and nothing else.

00:52:03.588 --> 00:52:06.428
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

00:52:06.628 --> 00:52:09.308
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

00:52:09.508 --> 00:52:11.508
It is done by the nature.

00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:13.268
Done by Shri Ganesha.

00:52:13.468 --> 00:52:17.148
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

00:52:17.348 --> 00:52:24.148
But, then what is the relationship?

00:52:26.228 --> 00:52:31.708
The relationship is, they are all in my body

00:52:31.908 --> 00:52:35.908
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

00:52:36.108 --> 00:52:38.108
and they act.

00:52:38.308 --> 00:52:40.028
This is the relationship,

00:52:40.188 --> 00:52:44.988
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

00:52:45.188 --> 00:52:47.348
For example, the fan is built in

00:52:47.548 --> 00:52:51.268
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:53.788
It´s like that.

00:52:53.988 --> 00:52:57.348
All of them are related to me,

00:52:57.548 --> 00:53:01.468
and they have a tremendous protocol,

00:53:01.668 --> 00:53:03.908
tremendous respect,

00:53:04.108 --> 00:53:11.908
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

00:53:12.108 --> 00:53:14.548
You see this thing is that

00:53:14.748 --> 00:53:21.068
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

00:53:21.268 --> 00:53:26.268
that you are a human being,

00:53:26.468 --> 00:53:28.868
that there is built in.

00:53:29.068 --> 00:53:33.148
Within you are your dharmas

00:53:33.348 --> 00:53:37.068
and if you go against your dharmas

00:53:37.268 --> 00:53:40.948
then you´ll be finished.

00:53:41.148 --> 00:53:44.588
They´re all built in within you,

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:50.668
they are all there, potentially.

00:53:50.868 --> 00:53:56.828
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

00:53:57.028 --> 00:54:03.668
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

00:54:04.508 --> 00:54:07.308
So thank you very much all of you.

00:54:07.508 --> 00:54:10.228
May God bless you!!
