00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:08.283
What is it?

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:14.273
She wants to know how to settle her attention,

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.056
and how to go deeper in meditation.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:21.273
Your attention goes to which places, is the point.

00:00:21.483 --> 00:00:24.353
You try to see around more.

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:41.373
You see, first of all in meditation you must discuss this,

00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:45.342
and there are many others who can tell you, they'll work it out.

00:00:45.423 --> 00:00:47.443
And secondly the best way, you see,

00:00:48.263 --> 00:00:50.413
is to put your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:54.383
Concentrate on the Mother Earth is the best way.

00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:56.353
When you are walking,

00:00:56.463 --> 00:00:58.403
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:00.323
If somebody is talking to you,

00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:02.373
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:05.263
You see, then you'll absorb everything better

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:08.483
and you'll be stationed better, all right?

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:18.263
That's a very good thing to think about, that our attention should not be frittered away.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.222
Gradually you'll settle down.

00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:25.383
I think most of you who have come for the first time

00:01:25.463 --> 00:01:28.413
will find it a little difficult in the beginning to adjust,

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:30.343
but gradually you will.

00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:33.373
Because first of all our attention goes to small,

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:37.453
small things, like I have to sit on the ground

00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:40.373
or You have to go by buses ,

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.192
or some sort of a filthy thing you see somewhere.

00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:45.343
So the attention always goes to the defects

00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:47.373
and the loopholes and to the filth,

00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:49.383
because attention has been like that.

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:52.735
But then it starts going to the places of beauty.

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:58.323
In little, little things you start seeing the beauty, in little, little things you start seeing the Divine.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:03.970
And then that's the time you should know that your attention will enjoy everything.

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:08.337
But normally you see the attention, specially the kind of attentions we have,

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:09.689
goes to the wrong things.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.697
What is the loophole? We start judging everyone, we start judging every place.

00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:17.263
Now see this place, if you sit here: to Me it is marvelous,

00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:20.383
to you it may be just made out of what - this tin business,

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:23.343
this, that; all that you will start thinking.

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:26.030
To Me it's beautiful,

00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:29.373
because I see these beautiful saris spread here

00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:32.433
and the beautiful flower arrangements beautifully done,

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:34.273
something so special.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:37.273
And the background and everything done with such care.

00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:41.202
How did they go there,
and how did they have these things tied up?

00:02:41.283 --> 00:02:44.242
It is remarkable. 
All these things come to My mind,

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:50.182
and I start feeling very overjoyed that My boys
have worked so hard to put all these things up

00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:52.495
and how nicely, how they must have arranged it.

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:55.403
All these ideas come into My head and I feel very elevated.

00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:58.975
I don't see the tins or I don't see anything else.

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:02.006
It is what you see, where your attention goes.

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:05.372
So try to see something beautiful.

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:08.343
There is so many beautiful things that one can see.

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:11.894
Now where, what I see is the heart of My children,

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.373
the way they have done it, isn't it?

00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:18.518
If you are a deep person you can see
how they have spread the saris sweetly,

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.192
how they have spread the flowers, how they've done it.

00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:24.353
So it is the attention: where does it go?

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:27.433
When you start seeing for yourself, What is my comfort?

00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:29.413
I should have this, I should have that,

00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:32.273
then there is no joy.

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:36.433
But the joy lies in seeing the deeper side of what they have done for us,

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.227
how they have worked for us,

00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:41.560
how they have brought things for us,
how they have cooked for us with love.

00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:45.212
You are doing no work
compared to what these people are doing, no doubt.

00:03:45.293 --> 00:03:49.332
You are moving like royal people really, to be...

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.353
And they had to do it.

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:55.323
Specially Ganapatipule was very difficult place.

00:03:55.383 --> 00:04:01.181
People had to come all the way from Nagpur,
fifty people came to cook your food.

00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:04.182
Money is not everything.

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:07.262
Even if you pay money, you can't do that. It's love,

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:10.192
it's the feeling, it's the attention,

00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:14.293
it's the generosity of looking after the guests.

00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:23.283
And that is how one should enjoy

00:04:23.373 --> 00:04:26.393
how much they have done for us, how we are enjoying it.

00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:29.343
That's how your heart will become deeper and deeper.

00:10:42.473 --> 00:10:45.413
Now, today's puja has really a lot of importance as it is

00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:48.413
today the Puja of Shri Mahalakshmi, and the importance

00:10:48.463 --> 00:10:52.293
which we have of Shri Mahalakshmi in Sahaja Yoga is of

00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:55.353
no other Shakti. Because Shri Mahalakshmi is the Shakti

00:10:55.423 --> 00:10:58.323
which we call as the Sushumna channel,

00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:01.503
She resides in it, and through Her

00:11:02.303 --> 00:11:05.303
the parasympathetic nervous system is activated.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.483
To make this Mahalakshmini Shakti strong, in our evolution

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:11.493
there occurred many events, and in this the

00:11:12.293 --> 00:11:15.413
important event was the incarnation of Shri Mahalakshmi.

00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:18.383
Shri Mahalakshmini took many incarnations,

00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:21.403
and She is so courageous that She took

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.443
the form of a human body and took birth in this Universe,

00:11:24.443 --> 00:11:27.483
and has done a lot of work.

00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:30.473
It is surprising that nobody gave us information

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.463
about all these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:11:34.273 --> 00:11:38.353
and nobody has the deep and detailed description about this.

00:11:38.403 --> 00:11:41.403
Now the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is based

00:11:41.453 --> 00:11:45.493
on the Principle of Shri Lakshmi. That means the Mother

00:11:46.303 --> 00:11:48.313
of Shri Lakshmi is Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:51.353
we should say, the Mother of Shri Lakshmi.

00:11:51.423 --> 00:11:54.323
That means when Shri Lakshmi comes to humans,

00:11:54.383 --> 00:11:57.323
Shri Lakshmi is the one with balance,

00:11:57.393 --> 00:12:00.343
a woman in the form of a Devi.

00:12:00.413 --> 00:12:04.433
She is in such a balance that She stands on a lotus.

00:12:04.503 --> 00:12:07.353
She has two lotuses in Her hand.

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:10.353
One of the lotuses is pink, and also in that

00:12:10.413 --> 00:12:14.303
lotus is also a tenderness. The meaning of the pink lotus

00:12:14.363 --> 00:12:17.503
is such that the person who is a lakshmipati, he will have

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:21.423
Shri Lakshmi, that is in the character of that person

00:12:21.503 --> 00:12:25.433
will be this pinkness that means will have sweetness in

00:12:25.483 --> 00:12:28.383
his character. He should not be dry.

00:12:28.453 --> 00:12:32.383
The second thing is that if we would see a lotus, then

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:35.453
in that lotus, even if a bee comes into it, this bee gets

00:12:36.263 --> 00:12:39.423
also a place in it, and the bee has so many thorns,

00:12:39.503 --> 00:12:42.493
but even then it gets a place in the lotus. That means

00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:46.313
it is also welcomed. Therefore, the person who has

00:12:46.393 --> 00:12:50.323
Shri Lakshmi, he will welcome everyone, however the guest is.

00:12:50.393 --> 00:12:52.493
He will ask for the comforts of everyone,

00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:55.313
even if that person is small or big. He will take care

00:12:55.313 --> 00:12:57.503
of everyone according to their social status,

00:12:57.503 --> 00:13:01.313
he will be hospitable to everyone in a equal way.

00:13:01.383 --> 00:13:04.383
Third thing is that the meaning of it is

00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:09.333
that one should be generous. And if in the hand of a person

00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:12.493
there is no generosity, then such a person

00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:16.423
is not a lakshmipati. Danat (the quality of generosity)

00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:19.293
is such a joy-giving quality,

00:13:19.363 --> 00:13:23.263
and it cannot be compared with acquiring anything.

00:13:23.343 --> 00:13:26.293
The person who attains the power of generosity,

00:13:26.363 --> 00:13:29.263
I think such a person is the greatest of all,

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:32.303
because such a person has reached to the

00:13:32.373 --> 00:13:34.473
culmination point in the evolution of mankind.

00:13:35.303 --> 00:13:37.493
One should be able to give generously. As Shri Lakshmi

00:13:38.303 --> 00:13:41.413
donates with the left hand, in the same way

00:13:41.483 --> 00:13:45.283
a person who is lakshmiputra (indicating the principle of

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:49.263
Lakshmi in a man) should also give generously with his left

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:52.463
hand in such a way that even the right hand does not know it.

00:13:53.283 --> 00:13:56.493
Giving with the left hand signifies giving very sahaj

00:13:57.313 --> 00:14:01.283
(spontaneously) without any effort. And all the desire

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:05.363
must be only of generosity. And truly in this world

00:14:05.433 --> 00:14:09.273
there are so many material things, and I think for

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:12.283
all these things there is only one importance,

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:15.323
and that is these things we can give to others.

00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:19.303
By means of generosity we can show the greatness

00:14:19.373 --> 00:14:23.383
of our heart. We can show our affection and warmth,

00:14:23.453 --> 00:14:27.283
and that is why all these things have importance,

00:14:27.353 --> 00:14:30.303
otherwise there is no importance of all the material things.

00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:33.373
There are so many statues of swayambhus. Amongst

00:14:33.443 --> 00:14:37.293
them the statue of Shri Mahalakshmi is considered as the

00:14:37.373 --> 00:14:41.413
most important by us in Sahaja Yoga. By Her grace our

00:14:41.483 --> 00:14:45.323
By Her grace our Kundalini rises in the channel

00:14:45.413 --> 00:14:48.473
of Shri Mahalakshmi. She is above Shri Lakshmi Principle.

00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:52.433
Now this (right) hand is like this.

00:14:53.273 --> 00:14:57.283
This hand is the symbol of shelter.

00:14:57.353 --> 00:15:01.363
It has two meanings: shelter - give shelter to everyone,

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:04.453
this hand gives protection to everyone. But in reality

00:15:05.273 --> 00:15:09.263
we see just the opposite. The lakshmipatis put a lot of

00:15:09.323 --> 00:15:12.493
pressure and fear on everyone. On the contrary

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:16.343
She (Lakshmi) is just standing quietly on a lotus,

00:15:16.443 --> 00:15:19.433
not showing off anything special about Her. Otherwise

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:23.363
people need cars and this and that, to show that they are

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:26.433
so wealthy and are superior in comparison to others.

00:15:27.263 --> 00:15:30.383
On the other hand She is not putting any weight or

00:15:30.453 --> 00:15:34.433
pressure on others. She is standing so lightly, so delicate

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.333
that nobody should be troubled because of Her. The real

00:15:37.393 --> 00:15:41.293
lakshmipati will sit somewhere in the corner, will sit

00:15:41.343 --> 00:15:44.473
with complete faith and silence, and will leave quietly.

00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:48.263
Even if he wants to give something he will give

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:51.353
and say, Shri Mataji, this is something which is

00:15:51.423 --> 00:15:54.373
my donation, but please do not disclose my

00:15:54.373 --> 00:15:56.483
name, and You accept it somehow. I have given this

00:15:57.313 --> 00:15:59.443
at Your Lotus Feet - finished now, I have nothing

00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:03.273
to do with it any more. When I tell him that I do not

00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:05.453
take money but it is to be given to the trust

00:16:06.263 --> 00:16:08.423
(and for which we have to know the name of the donor)

00:16:08.493 --> 00:16:11.413
he will say, You can put it in the name of anybody else,

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.463
I have no objection. I have given this to You,

00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:18.353
I do not want my name to published. Only if You want to

00:16:18.403 --> 00:16:21.463
disclose my name to the income tax authorities I do not mind,

00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:25.343
but otherwise I do not want my name or anything.

00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:29.433
He will be requesting very humbly not to disclose his name.

00:16:29.483 --> 00:16:33.303
This person we can call is a real lakshmipati.

00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:36.403
The (right) hand of Shri Lakshmi is pointing up in this way.

00:16:36.453 --> 00:16:39.313
That means your attention should be above, towards a

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.503
higher goal. So when a person becomes a lakshmipati,

00:16:42.323 --> 00:16:45.273
then his attention is such that he starts thinking,

00:16:45.273 --> 00:16:48.313
Now I have become lakshmipati, but now, how can

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:52.263
I attain God? When this stage comes in a human being,

00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:56.293
he has wealth and he receives a lot of wealth. Becomes rich,

00:16:56.353 --> 00:17:00.283
and then when he gets the feeling of not achieving the inner

00:17:00.343 --> 00:17:03.493
richness, then one can say that the Principle

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:07.373
of Shri Mahalakshmi has been awakened in him.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:10.453
And in that Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi the Kundalini

00:17:11.283 --> 00:17:14.363
is awakened. When She is awakened that is why we say,

00:17:14.423 --> 00:17:17.443
"Udo, Ambe" meaning: "Shri Kundalini, please, get awakened."

00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:21.263
We say this in the temple of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:17:21.343 --> 00:17:23.413
because She can get awakened only through

00:17:23.493 --> 00:17:27.273
the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi. And thus She is awakened

00:17:27.343 --> 00:17:30.273
in the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi and then penetrates

00:17:30.353 --> 00:17:32.403
the above chakras, and comes up and completely

00:17:32.473 --> 00:17:35.273
penetrates the Chakra of Sahasrara. Now let us see

00:17:35.343 --> 00:17:37.463
how many incarnations of Shi Mahalakshmi we've had.

00:17:38.303 --> 00:17:41.393
Firstly, the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is very close

00:17:41.473 --> 00:17:44.473
with a guru, a relation of plenty of love and purity.

00:17:45.303 --> 00:17:48.333
Now if we see from the beginning, by all the Adi Gurus,

00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:51.403
She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister.

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:55.343
Like the daughter of Janaka was Shri Sita - the form

00:17:55.423 --> 00:18:00.503
of Mahalakshmi. She was the Principle of Mahalakshmi.

00:18:01.323 --> 00:18:03.393
and She was the daughter of Janaka.

00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:06.303
Then the sister of Shri Nanaka - Nanaki -

00:18:06.393 --> 00:18:09.303
She was Mahalakshmi. Her relation was of sister.

00:18:09.373 --> 00:18:11.503
In the same way, the daughter of Mohammed Sahib, Fatima,

00:18:12.313 --> 00:18:14.433
She was Mahalakshmi. After Her, Radha was the form:

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:17.363
of Mahalakshmi, then comes Mary:

00:18:17.433 --> 00:18:20.293
Mary was Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:18:20.383 --> 00:18:23.283
and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure

00:18:23.363 --> 00:18:25.473
that with Her purity She gave birth to Shri Christ.

00:18:26.303 --> 00:18:28.393
So She was a form of complete pure Virgin.

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:31.363
And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity,

00:18:31.453 --> 00:18:34.333
She got a son pure as Christ.

00:18:34.423 --> 00:18:36.463
Because of these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:18:37.313 --> 00:18:39.353
our chakras at the top within are being fixed up.

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.413
That means Shri Rama's Chakra is on the right side

00:18:42.493 --> 00:18:45.473
of the heart, here She is in the form of Shri Sita,

00:18:46.303 --> 00:18:48.373
here She is in the form of Radha,

00:18:48.483 --> 00:18:51.343
here in the form of Mary. And at this place these powers of

00:18:51.433 --> 00:18:54.443
Shri Mahakali, Shri Mahalakshmi and Shri Mahasaraswati

00:18:55.283 --> 00:18:56.483
meets in the form of one Power which is Shri Adi Shakti.

00:18:57.323 --> 00:18:59.473
She recides in Sahasrara

00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:03.273
but it is said that in Sahasrara

00:19:03.383 --> 00:19:06.393
She exists in a form of Mahamaya.

00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:09.403
Adi Shakti is of a form of Mahamaya.

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:12.323
That is why the result of all these three Powers

00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:15.413
was like this, that Adi Shakti comes

00:19:16.263 --> 00:19:19.373
into this world in the form of Mahamaya

00:19:19.443 --> 00:19:22.413
and She can penetrate the Sahasrara of everyone.

00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:25.433
As you know, She is in front of you

00:19:26.263 --> 00:19:29.273
and you know all about it.

00:19:29.343 --> 00:19:31.463
So I don't need to tell anything more.

00:19:32.293 --> 00:19:34.433
This is how, out of this Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:37.423
Shri Adi Shakti was incarnated. She has got all

00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:40.313
the three Powers of Shri Mahakali, Mahalakshmi

00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:43.343
and Shri Mahasaraswati. These Powers are within Her.

00:19:43.413 --> 00:19:46.263
Only through this Shri Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.493
our pure desire - which is Shri Amba, actually power of

00:19:49.343 --> 00:19:52.503
Shri Mahakali - can be awakened. She can do it.

00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:56.453
That is why Adi Shakti is so important, because through

00:19:57.313 --> 00:20:00.453
these three Powers, even if everything is ready, but

00:20:01.303 --> 00:20:05.263
at the last what work has to be done,She is need.

00:20:05.363 --> 00:20:08.423
That means the work is achieved through these Powers.

00:20:09.263 --> 00:20:12.313
Even if this thing is very easy for us to achive,

00:20:12.403 --> 00:20:16.273
we do get it easily, but still you have to work hard;

00:20:16.353 --> 00:20:19.503
otherwise that work cannot be done.

00:20:20.323 --> 00:20:23.343
It is quite difficult. If it would have been possible

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:26.383
only by Shri Adi Shakti, then there wouldn't be any need

00:20:26.483 --> 00:20:30.303
of doing all such confusion.

00:20:30.393 --> 00:20:33.343
You have to work hard,

00:20:33.423 --> 00:20:36.363
and your support is required to accomplish the task.

00:20:36.473 --> 00:20:39.293
You are on the stage now, not Me.

00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:41.483
You can take My power and use It,

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:44.463
but know that now you are on the stage.

00:20:45.313 --> 00:20:47.463
And that is why you are worthy of worship. You are special.

00:20:48.293 --> 00:20:49.503
What am I? Whatever powers I have,

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:53.283
I have them since eternity; there is nothing special about it.

00:20:53.373 --> 00:20:56.303
But you should use them. You must receive it,

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:59.503
you must achieve it, you should have mastery over it.

00:21:00.363 --> 00:21:03.313
This is the real desire of Shri Adi Shakti,

00:21:03.383 --> 00:21:07.263
this is Her pure desire. And for this pure desire

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:10.383
She is striving very hard every moment. And in this

00:21:10.483 --> 00:21:14.263
you have all earned it, achieved it, accepted with love,

00:21:14.343 --> 00:21:17.343
and going ahead you have progressed in it.

00:21:17.413 --> 00:21:20.283
This is a very big satisfaction for Me.

00:21:20.353 --> 00:21:22.493
And in this satisfaction I forget everything,

00:21:23.303 --> 00:21:26.333
like how much I had to suffer in the past.

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:28.483
In the past many years I suffered a lot.

00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:31.323
How much Sita had to suffer, how much Radha

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:34.493
had to suffer, how much Mary had to suffer:

00:21:35.323 --> 00:21:37.383
I forget all that past. I feel

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.383
as if nothing has happened in the past, and that

00:21:40.503 --> 00:21:43.363
whatever is happening now is something special.

00:21:43.463 --> 00:21:47.393
But in this incarnation one thing is to be remembered,

00:21:47.483 --> 00:21:51.363
that Shri Mahalakshmi has incarnated in human form

00:21:51.463 --> 00:21:53.493
- in human form. But the Devi which we call

00:21:54.323 --> 00:21:56.453
as Shri Mahakali has not incarnated in human form.

00:21:57.303 --> 00:21:59.343
She always existed in the form of a Devi.

00:21:59.463 --> 00:22:02.403
That is why to come in the form of Devi is easy,

00:22:03.263 --> 00:22:05.493
but to come in the form of a human being is very

00:22:06.323 --> 00:22:09.313
difficult task. And to fight like a human being and

00:22:09.393 --> 00:22:12.403
live with the human beings is even more difficult.

00:22:12.503 --> 00:22:16.343
Also to live, keeping within the limitations of human beings,

00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:19.493
is much more difficult. All this work in the form of human

00:22:20.363 --> 00:22:23.473
beings was done by all the Devas, and today we are experiencing

00:22:24.313 --> 00:22:27.483
the auspicious fruits of all the work done in the past.

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:31.443
The great work done in Ganapatipule is worthy to be written

00:22:32.293 --> 00:22:34.483
in history; big work has been done, and it will keep

00:22:34.503 --> 00:22:37.423
happening every year ahead. My ardent desire is that

00:22:37.483 --> 00:22:39.263
it continue at least for the next three, four years.

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:42.363
If this happens, then you people will also get the idea, that

00:22:42.413 --> 00:22:44.413
what we've started from Ganapati

00:22:44.473 --> 00:22:46.473
has reached perfectly Sahasrara.

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:50.433
This is so Aditi (Primordial) that it's difficult to express

00:22:51.263 --> 00:22:55.263
in words. And all this you should receive. You should receive

00:22:55.413 --> 00:22:58.473
whatever belongs to Me, this is My only pure disire.

00:22:59.323 --> 00:23:02.333
And when this works out, then I don't want anything
