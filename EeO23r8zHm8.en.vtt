00:00.860 --> 00:05.580
Now, the question is, for a modern man,
whether to believe

00:05.780 --> 00:08.860
that there are spirits or not.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.780
Because it’s a very unknown area.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.980
And the unknown area,

00:17.260 --> 00:22.500
unless and until it is fully explored
and found out,

00:22.700 --> 00:28.340
always creates a hallucination
that it is something divine.

00:28.540 --> 00:31.260
So we have to know even about spirits:

00:31.460 --> 00:36.500
who are they, how they act,
and how they work out.

00:37.460 --> 00:39.420
Now, many will say
that “We do not believe in spirits.”

00:39.620 --> 00:43.260
Whether you believe it or not —
but they are there.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.420
Christ, He was not a liar.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.060
He took out spirits
and put them in the pig.

00:48.260 --> 00:53.740
And He is the man who very clearly said
that “Keep away from the spirits.”

00:55.660 --> 00:58.700
The spirits are the people.

00:59.620 --> 01:03.780
We can be spirits tomorrow
if we want to be.

01:03.980 --> 01:08.060
When we die, we do not die fully.

01:08.260 --> 01:13.540
Only the element of earth,
which has created us…

01:14.340 --> 01:16.420
for appearance, or which is the…

01:16.620 --> 01:20.460
we can say, the Jala Tattva
[Water Principle], with the gross form —

01:20.660 --> 01:24.260
that portion only dies,
the rest of it remains.

01:24.460 --> 01:28.220
And it goes into an area

01:28.420 --> 01:31.260
which we call as Pretaloka
[the world of the dead],

01:31.460 --> 01:34.700
where it starts becoming
smaller and smaller

01:34.900 --> 01:38.260
till it comes to the size

01:39.060 --> 01:42.780
of a foetus,

01:43.780 --> 01:48.420
or, you can say, a very small foetus.

01:48.620 --> 01:51.620
It waits there.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.940
But some of the people, when they die,

01:57.140 --> 02:00.660
they are dissatisfied souls.

02:00.860 --> 02:05.500
In Sanskrit we call them
as atrupta atma [unsatisfied soul].

02:05.740 --> 02:11.140
Means, in life they have been hankering
after things too much,

02:11.420 --> 02:17.100
and they couldn’t get to their goals,
and they died.

02:17.340 --> 02:20.060
For example, a mother dies
during labour pains.

02:20.260 --> 02:23.060
Her child is born;
she sees the child and dies.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.100
She is worried
about looking after that child.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.460
A father dies suddenly in an accident.

02:30.660 --> 02:32.180
His children are left behind,

02:32.380 --> 02:36.260
and he is worried about his children
they’re looked after.

02:36.460 --> 02:40.060
There are some people
who are very ambitious in life —

02:40.260 --> 02:42.900
very, very ambitious —

02:43.100 --> 02:46.140
and they die before fulfilling
their ambitions.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.940
They also become spirits.

02:49.140 --> 02:53.900
There are people who have been tortured
and troubled and killed.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.820
They also die, and they don’t want
to live in the Pretaloka,

02:59.020 --> 03:02.620
but they want to trouble the people
who have troubled them.

03:02.820 --> 03:07.100
So there are types and types of people
who become spirits.

03:07.300 --> 03:11.260
We can divide them into two types.

03:11.580 --> 03:18.500
One type is the one
which is very aggressive,

03:21.580 --> 03:26.060
ambitious, egoistical,

03:26.260 --> 03:29.900
oppressive person,

03:30.100 --> 03:33.060
who dies and becomes a spirit.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.180
That area is known
as the supraconscious area.

03:37.380 --> 03:41.500
So many gurus and sadhus [ascetics]
who renounce the world

03:41.700 --> 03:44.900
and go to the Himalayas,
and break their necks,

03:45.100 --> 03:48.780
and do all kinds of frantic things,

03:48.980 --> 03:51.420
which we call as dravidi pranayam
[a roundabout way of doing a thing] —

03:51.620 --> 03:54.860
when they die without Realization,

03:55.060 --> 03:59.260
they also are
on the supraconscious side.

04:01.940 --> 04:07.100
And they remain on the right-hand side
of the human being.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.100
On the left-hand side…

04:09.300 --> 04:12.260
“Human being” because human being
is a reflection

04:12.460 --> 04:18.460
or, we can say, is the same microcosm
of the macrocosm, which is the Virata.

04:20.540 --> 04:25.260
Hence they are reflected
on the right-hand side of the Virata,

04:25.460 --> 04:27.780
and so we should say

04:27.980 --> 04:31.940
that they are available
on our right-hand side.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.420
The other ones,

04:34.620 --> 04:39.980
we can say that they are… they belong
to the category of the people

04:40.180 --> 04:42.460
who are suppressed, who are oppressed,

04:42.660 --> 04:45.020
who are tortured, who are troubled,

04:45.220 --> 04:48.500
who are debased, who are insulted.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.980
Such people, when they die,

04:52.180 --> 04:56.340
they want to take their revenge
by their sly methods.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.980
So they remain on the left-hand side
of the Virata

05:00.180 --> 05:04.020
and thus are reflected in us also,
in the collective subconscious,

05:04.220 --> 05:07.580
which is on the left-hand side.

05:11.300 --> 05:17.980
Basically, these are the two styles
of people who are becoming spirits.

05:18.180 --> 05:23.220
But there can be a mixture,
there can be every type of a spirit.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.420
There could be good spirits also,
good people,

05:26.620 --> 05:31.300
who are trying to only help
their families and things like that.

05:33.380 --> 05:38.780
These spirits try to manifest.

05:39.740 --> 05:44.300
For example,
the supraconscious type spirits.

05:45.340 --> 05:50.740
There was a doctor in London, who died.
His name was Dr Lang.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.940
When he died,
he had discovered lots of things,

05:54.140 --> 05:56.820
and he wanted to continue
with his practice in London —

05:57.020 --> 05:58.660
and he was a surgeon —

05:58.860 --> 06:01.700
but he could not do it,
because he suddenly died.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.060
So his spirit entered into a soldier

06:05.260 --> 06:09.380
who was living in…
who was fighting in Vietnam.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.260
And when the spirit entered into him

06:11.460 --> 06:13.940
and told him
that “I am such and such doctor,

06:14.140 --> 06:18.220
you must go and meet my son
and my brother

06:18.420 --> 06:22.020
and tell them that I am within you,”
the soldier could not believe it,

06:22.220 --> 06:25.940
but then he said
that “You come along with me,
and I’ll guide you to that place.”

06:26.140 --> 06:30.420
And he took him to that hospital
where this doctor was working.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.980
The hospital was closed,
the surgery was closed,

06:34.180 --> 06:38.540
so he went and saw the son,
and he told him about this spirit
entering into his body.

06:38.740 --> 06:40.780
The son could not believe it.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.900
So he said that “I will tell you
all the secrets of our life

06:44.100 --> 06:46.500
that we spent together
and which no one knows.”

06:46.700 --> 06:48.700
And when he started
telling him all these things,

06:48.900 --> 06:51.300
he was amazed, he said,
“All right, I’ll open the centre.”

06:51.500 --> 06:53.620
So they opened
a very-big-news organization

06:53.820 --> 06:59.820
known as Late Dr Lang’s International
Curative Centre in London.

07:00.540 --> 07:03.220
Now, this organization
started working long time back,

07:03.420 --> 07:06.260
about, I think, eleven
or twelve years back.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.060
Actually, I came to know about it
because somebody who was suffering

07:09.260 --> 07:11.900
from the treatment
of one of these people,

07:12.100 --> 07:14.220
she came to Me
and she told Me all about this,

07:14.420 --> 07:19.220
and she gave Me a pamphlet
in which they had written
all this story about Dr Lang.

07:19.420 --> 07:23.460
And what they used to say —
that “You should write to us
about your illness whatever it is.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.180
And when you write to us,
then we will organize it in such a way

07:26.380 --> 07:30.540
that at such a time, at such a point,
at such a place —

07:30.740 --> 07:32.180
whichever place you suggest —

07:32.380 --> 07:34.900
something will happen to you:
you’ll start shaking in the body

07:35.100 --> 07:38.460
and you’ll get those spirits into you
and you’ll be cured.”

07:38.660 --> 07:42.380
It happened with this lady,
the one who came to Me first
when she told Me.

07:42.580 --> 07:47.220
Then afterwards I’ve met many of them,
even in England I’ve met some of them.

07:47.420 --> 07:48.980
So, when she came to Me…

07:49.180 --> 07:52.900
You see, what was her trouble was…
she said that “I had some trouble.”

07:53.100 --> 07:55.540
I think she had some minor trouble,
which was cured

07:55.740 --> 07:58.420
but was very inconvenient thing
for her —

07:58.620 --> 08:00.940
sort of a… it was a nuisance,
the trouble was.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.900
She was definitely cured with that.

08:03.100 --> 08:07.060
But after, say, five, six years or so,

08:07.260 --> 08:09.860
she started, you see,
shaking her body completely.

08:10.060 --> 08:12.900
Her nervousness was so much
that she couldn’t see Me.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.020
When she sat before Me,
she started shaking,

08:15.220 --> 08:17.260
her hands started shaking,
body started shaking

08:17.460 --> 08:20.060
as if a lunatic would do that
before Me.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.900
So I told her, “See, this gentleman
has come from lunatic asylum,

08:23.100 --> 08:25.100
and he is behaving the same way
as you are behaving.”

08:25.300 --> 08:27.100
She says, “I know.
Because I have a pain here,

08:27.300 --> 08:29.620
I have a problem here…
And I know there’s something wrong.

08:29.820 --> 08:32.580
I am not thinking properly,
and I cannot remember anything.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.860
I am a lost soul,
and I know what has happened to me.

08:35.060 --> 08:36.460
Now what can You do about it?”

08:36.660 --> 08:38.460
Of course, I then cured her, no doubt.

08:38.660 --> 08:41.460
Because in Sahaja Yoga you can —

08:41.660 --> 08:43.580
through vibrations of love,

08:43.780 --> 08:46.260
this Divine Love
which I told you yesterday —

08:46.460 --> 08:50.860
you can give a bondage
to those spirits.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.460
By that bondage,

08:52.660 --> 08:56.540
you can make that bondage pass
into the Pretaloka, and they disappear.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.820
But some of these are controlled

08:59.020 --> 09:03.060
by some of these ambitious
so-called gurus.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.580
Now, these so-called gurus
that you know of —

09:05.780 --> 09:09.580
so-called, they call themselves gurus —
what do they do?

09:09.780 --> 09:13.060
They go… you see, if they find
some evil genius dies somewhere —

09:13.260 --> 09:15.860
they know he is an evil genius —
then they follow his body,

09:16.060 --> 09:19.540
they go to smashan [burning-ground],
they try to collect a part of his body,

09:19.740 --> 09:22.060
and they keep it with them.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.740
Now, the spirit, till thirteen days,
moves around the body,

09:25.940 --> 09:29.460
and it starts watching
what is the body doing.

09:29.660 --> 09:34.820
So, when the spirit, you see,
sees that his own part of his body —

09:35.020 --> 09:37.580
which is to form again
in his own body later on —

09:37.780 --> 09:40.300
is missing through these people
and they will be doing something,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.100
so it appears before them,
and they know how to talk.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.860
It’s easy to talk.
Even ordinary spirit person,

09:46.060 --> 09:48.100
if he comes here,
I can make them talk,

09:48.300 --> 09:50.500
and they talk quite a lot,
all kinds of nonsense,

09:50.700 --> 09:54.980
and they also tell about these people
what these people have been doing.

09:55.180 --> 10:00.580
So, that spirit then, you know,
is captured by these people,

10:00.780 --> 10:03.620
and they start using
these supraconscious spirits.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.820
These people being crooked

10:07.020 --> 10:13.020
and very intelligent people,

10:14.100 --> 10:16.820
they start acting into their hands.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.260
Now, these spirits
are given some names.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.740
Like, they can call them Ram, Krishna…

10:21.940 --> 10:23.180
Some people say Aim,

10:23.380 --> 10:26.420
some says Hrim, some says Klim —
all Goddess’s names, you see.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.900
They can even give the name of Jesus
or something like that.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.900
So, what happens — that, when these…
when you go to these gurus,

10:34.100 --> 10:37.020
then, when you ask them,
they say, “We’ll give you a mantra.”

10:37.220 --> 10:39.860
Now, you think that the mantra-giving
is a very great thing.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.860
You see, so many people
will come and tell Me —

10:42.060 --> 10:44.820
in Marathi also, Maharashtrians
are special ones for this —

10:45.020 --> 10:48.660
that “Mataji, mala kani guru mantra dila
[some guru gave me a mantra].”

10:48.860 --> 10:50.660
After all, a mantra can be given…

10:50.860 --> 10:53.180
say, kay dila mantra “Ram”
[what if mantra “Ram” is given]?

10:53.380 --> 10:56.620
Why do you need a guru
to tell you this? Use your brains!

10:56.820 --> 10:58.220
Now, they go on saying “Ram”,

10:58.420 --> 11:00.780
and this fellow has already connected
them with the Ram

11:00.980 --> 11:04.060
whom they have appointed
to get into this fellow.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.380
So the Ram enters into the psyche
of this person.

11:06.580 --> 11:09.980
Mostly it is through this Agnya Chakra,
which I told you.

11:10.180 --> 11:12.140
Yesterday I described
the whole Kundalini

11:12.340 --> 11:13.820
and its places and everything.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.420
So it enters through this
into the psyche.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.980
When it enters into the psyche
on the right-hand side,

11:19.180 --> 11:21.540
you see, on the ego side
it enters into,

11:21.740 --> 11:23.860
and it starts making the man
very egoistical.

11:24.060 --> 11:27.820
He’ll beat his wife,
he’ll beat his children,
he’ll rave and try to show off.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.060
Sometimes such a man
might get a promotion,

11:30.260 --> 11:31.540
and he’ll become so dynamic,

11:31.740 --> 11:34.380
he will… people will say,
“Oh, what has happened to him?” and…

11:34.580 --> 11:37.580
sort of, you see, his attention,
which was…

11:37.780 --> 11:39.740
was spent in doing other things,

11:39.940 --> 11:43.340
will be diverted
to very ambitious style of work.

11:43.540 --> 11:46.900
Now, he becomes very ambitious,
but he has no dharma in him,

11:47.100 --> 11:49.460
no love in him, no compassion in him,

11:49.660 --> 11:52.300
but he becomes
a very so-called successful man.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.940
For a short time.

11:55.140 --> 11:58.900
But after… I’ve met many like them
in Delhi also,

11:59.100 --> 12:01.460
those who have been
“initiated” like that

12:01.660 --> 12:07.220
by paying quite a lot of money
to these swamis and sadhus —

12:07.420 --> 12:10.020
and before Me
they were just rattling like this.

12:10.220 --> 12:13.740
And they said, “Mataji, this is such a lot
we are rattling before You,

12:13.940 --> 12:18.260
but even if we take a… even if we burn
a udbatti [kind of incense sticks]

12:18.460 --> 12:20.100
in the name of God Virata,

12:20.300 --> 12:24.100
we can’t go near a temple,
we can’t go near a church.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.340
If we see anything of God,
we start rattling like this.”

12:27.540 --> 12:29.780
And they all have resigned
from their jobs

12:29.980 --> 12:32.500
and are settled down
as useless people.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.140
This has happened to them
within five, six years time.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.060
Young people, very young.

12:37.260 --> 12:41.180
In Singapore I’ve met one fellow.
No, not — Kuala Lumpur.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.420
You would not believe
he is only twenty-two years of age,

12:44.620 --> 12:47.020
and he is like that now.

12:47.220 --> 12:51.260
And this is the supraconscious style —
they call it transcendental thought.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.340
This is the trance they use.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.780
So, just by giving you one name —
you must also think!

12:56.980 --> 13:01.660
After all, you cannot call like that
your God, the Almighty.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.940
By just a name?! How can you call Him!
Is He your servant?

13:05.140 --> 13:08.180
“Rama gari [fellow, man, man servant],
come along.” Can you call Him like this?

13:08.380 --> 13:12.340
“You do my job, You look after my father,
You look after my mother.”

13:12.540 --> 13:14.620
Who are you?

13:14.820 --> 13:16.620
Are you entitled to call like that?

13:16.820 --> 13:20.220
And can you just tell Him
that “You have to…

13:20.420 --> 13:22.540
You better look after everything
that I tell You,

13:22.740 --> 13:26.020
otherwise I’ll give You up.
I have no faith in You.”?

13:26.220 --> 13:30.140
The man in his ego starts thinking
these nonsensical things.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.140
You have to surrender to God.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.620
You have to become one with Him,
you have to be authorized.

13:34.820 --> 13:37.620
Then only you can ask His help.

13:37.820 --> 13:40.900
The another supraconscious people
are another type of…

13:41.100 --> 13:45.820
they work out in this way that, you see,
these people are the Hatha yogis —

13:46.020 --> 13:48.940
so-called Hatha yogis,
because I call them neo-Hatha yogis.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.380
They are not real Hatha yogis.

13:50.580 --> 13:55.300
The real Hatha yogis never stay
with the human… normal…

13:55.500 --> 13:57.340
what you call them…

13:57.540 --> 14:00.780
citizens of a city or a village.

14:00.980 --> 14:04.220
They stay in the forest with gurus.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.220
In the Patanjali Shastra,

14:06.420 --> 14:09.380
who is the original writer
of Hatha Yoga,

14:09.580 --> 14:12.380
he has told there are six things
a Hatha yogi has to do.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.260
He has to stay in the jungle
with a guru who is a realized soul,

14:16.460 --> 14:18.340
and he does not have to lead
a married life,

14:18.540 --> 14:21.140
he has to be a brahmacharya,
a celibate person.

14:21.340 --> 14:24.020
And he has to do six things together.

14:24.220 --> 14:27.340
In that, meditation is there,
prana pratishtha [calming of the breath],

14:27.540 --> 14:29.580
pratyahar [withdrawal of the senses],
yama-niyama [“dos” and “don’ts”]…

14:29.780 --> 14:32.580
All these things mean
he has to regulate his life,

14:32.780 --> 14:34.780
he has to lead
a very chaste and holy life.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.660
It is not meant for people
who are householders.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.180
Here now, for fashion’s sake,

14:39.380 --> 14:41.180
the Hatha Yoga has come
to all the people,

14:41.380 --> 14:45.100
and all Hatha yogis as such
get heart attacks.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.500
Yes, they do.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.020
I’ve met a doctor here —

14:48.220 --> 14:51.420
you might be knowing him also very well,
he was a very well-known doctor —

14:51.620 --> 14:53.900
and he was preaching Hatha Yoga,
and he had a heart trouble.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.500
And he was a heart specialist!

14:55.700 --> 14:59.180
And when I met him, I told him,
“Doctor, be careful about your heart.
You are catching on your heart.”

14:59.380 --> 15:01.180
He said, “How can that be?
I’ve taken my cardiogram!”

15:01.380 --> 15:04.220
I said, “Doctor, be careful
and don’t do this Hatha Yoga.”

15:04.420 --> 15:09.660
Because it is an extreme type
of a sadhana [spiritual practice],

15:09.860 --> 15:13.460
which is to be done with a person
who can balance you,

15:13.660 --> 15:15.980
where no other energy is exhausted,

15:16.180 --> 15:18.820
but only thing is,
it is just done for the sadhana,

15:19.020 --> 15:20.900
and your guru works it out.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.540
It is done by very few people.

15:23.740 --> 15:28.540
But nowadays everybody wants to become
a cinema actor and a cinema actress.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.620
Every girl wants to be [UNCLEAR]
certain shapes

15:31.820 --> 15:33.700
that are described
in the beauty contest.

15:33.900 --> 15:39.100
I tell you, these proportions
are absolutely satanic.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.700
I’ve read those proportions —

15:40.900 --> 15:44.060
they are not the proportions
of goddesses. Or of gods.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.340
These proportions that are described
in these beauty contest things

15:47.540 --> 15:50.140
are absolutely of dirty women.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.060
These proportions,
if they exist in any human being,

15:53.260 --> 15:54.860
only bad vibrations will come out.

15:55.060 --> 15:58.220
That’s why, you must have seen,
once they win that test,

15:58.420 --> 16:01.500
then you have seen
how they become funny.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.740
These are all human conceptions,
but all the human conceptions

16:04.940 --> 16:07.260
are such foolish things
that they do not know

16:07.460 --> 16:09.660
that they are playing
into the satanic forces.

16:09.860 --> 16:13.260
The idea about cinema actresses,
you see — all the ladies, these days,

16:13.460 --> 16:15.620
even in London,
even ninety-year-old women

16:15.820 --> 16:17.220
want to be actresses.

16:17.420 --> 16:20.060
Are they mad?

16:20.260 --> 16:23.260
They don’t want to be mothers.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.260
And then they will do
all kinds of dieting,

16:26.460 --> 16:28.180
torture their husbands,

16:28.380 --> 16:30.340
and they will… I don’t know
what they are up to.

16:30.540 --> 16:32.980
You have to be good wives,
decent wives.

16:33.180 --> 16:37.020
You have to be good mothers
first of all.

16:37.220 --> 16:41.060
You are married women,
you are not actresses.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.300
And the husbands also want
to be actors or what, I don’t know,

16:45.500 --> 16:46.740
that they are at Hatha Yoga.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.140
They want to make their body
very perfect

16:49.340 --> 16:51.780
in those dimensions
that they are described.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.460
Who has said that these dimensions
are the best?

16:54.660 --> 16:56.540
I mean, these days, when you see it,

16:56.740 --> 16:59.820
men, they don’t look like men,
and women don’t look like women.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.940
Women have started looking like men
or like horses,

17:03.140 --> 17:04.980
and men have started
looking like women.

17:05.180 --> 17:07.780
It’s a wretched system.

17:07.980 --> 17:10.860
We have to be women in the full way,

17:11.060 --> 17:13.900
and men have to be men in the full way.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.780
You have heard about Shivaji, Rana Pratap
[legendary Indian warrior kings]…

17:16.980 --> 17:19.980
You have seen their personalities.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.700
You see, all the descriptions
of these personalities

17:22.900 --> 17:24.260
going to drop down like anything

17:24.460 --> 17:27.940
when you see these “actors”
and “actresses”, teeny-leeny people:

17:28.140 --> 17:31.860
somebody slaps them once on the face,
the husband falls down dead,

17:32.060 --> 17:34.260
and the wife is running away
with another man —

17:34.460 --> 17:38.180
all sorts of things going on
in this ghor [terrible] Kali Yuga.

17:38.380 --> 17:42.460
This is only you are playing
into the satanic forces. Nothing else.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.540
But these, I tell you,
these supraconscious people

17:44.740 --> 17:46.100
are teaching you all these things.

17:46.300 --> 17:50.780
Then there are people
of extreme nature,

17:50.980 --> 17:52.300
women specially,

17:52.500 --> 17:54.900
who are pativrata
[devoted to a husband], you see.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.220
They are also nonsensical people.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.700
Because, you see,
they think they love their husband,

17:59.900 --> 18:01.700
the whole gods must fall onto them.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.420
Of course, a pativrata
is a very powerful personality.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.700
But she has to be a realized person.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.500
Otherwise, she is not realized,

18:08.700 --> 18:11.580
and she is all the time
making the husband, you see,

18:11.780 --> 18:14.940
a noose around his head all the time —
and using God for it.

18:15.140 --> 18:16.620
Is absurd!

18:16.820 --> 18:19.020
She must allow all the freedom
to the man,

18:19.220 --> 18:24.380
to man to understand
the complete play of life.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.380
These women also, when they die,
you see, they are afraid

18:27.580 --> 18:29.900
that their husband might marry
somebody else or whatever it is.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.140
They sit on the husband’s head only.

18:33.700 --> 18:37.460
Then the mothers, some of the mothers
who are so much involved

18:37.660 --> 18:42.020
and selfish and self-centred,
only love their own children.

18:42.220 --> 18:45.180
They’ll say:
“He is the only son I have,”

18:45.380 --> 18:47.780
“She is the only daughter I have.”

18:47.980 --> 18:50.980
But what does that mean?
Why are you so misidentified?

18:51.180 --> 18:53.420
How many times you have been born
in this world?

18:53.620 --> 18:55.420
How many children
you have had before?

18:55.620 --> 18:59.340
Why are you so much involved into it,
so much misidentified?

18:59.540 --> 19:01.500
That does not mean
that you kick your children.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.500
Either they will kick their children

19:03.700 --> 19:06.620
or they will be absolutely
downtrodden by the children.

19:06.820 --> 19:08.700
This is the extreme type
of temperament.

19:08.900 --> 19:11.820
Normal people, who love their children,
love other children also,

19:12.020 --> 19:15.660
live in a normal way,
normal, pious married life,

19:15.860 --> 19:19.500
don’t run after other men
and don’t run after other women —

19:19.700 --> 19:22.940
these normal people, when they die,
they go to Pretaloka,

19:23.140 --> 19:25.420
and then they are born again
as good people,

19:25.620 --> 19:30.300
and they, if they are born today,
they get Realization.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
There are kinds and kinds
and types and types.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.980
I don’t want to waste your time
and My time

19:35.180 --> 19:37.260
in describing all these horrid people.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.100
But on the other side,
on the left-hand side,

19:39.300 --> 19:42.020
the debased and the sly
and the horrid and the murderers

19:42.220 --> 19:44.180
and all that — they are all there.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.340
Oh, these are another type.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.340
Now, what these people try to do?

19:48.540 --> 19:54.180
You see, sometimes
they will do some sly things.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.700
But when these people enter,
these debased ones,

19:56.900 --> 20:00.540
when they enter into your psyche,
you become lunatic or mad,
or something happens.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.060
They teach you all kinds of things.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.740
They’ll teach you how to drink,
to take to drugs, to do these things;

20:04.940 --> 20:06.820
or if you are taking drinks,
they’ll enter into you.

20:07.020 --> 20:08.180
Because they are drunkards,

20:08.380 --> 20:10.460
so they want to drink more —
so they will drink.

20:10.660 --> 20:14.220
You’ll be amazed, you won’t believe
that in Cuba I met a lady,

20:14.420 --> 20:15.980
she was a very “dainty darling”,

20:16.180 --> 20:21.180
and she told Me that she can take
one whisky neat, one full bottle.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.420
I mean, I can’t even look at that bottle
the way she showed Me.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.260
I said, “How do you manage that?”

20:26.460 --> 20:28.900
And her husband said, “Really,
it is true, sometimes she does it.”

20:29.100 --> 20:31.740
So she says, “Do you know,
there’s a very big, huge Negro

20:31.940 --> 20:34.740
who enters into my body.
And then he drinks, not I.”

20:34.940 --> 20:38.380
She sees him coming inside this body.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.700
So these types of people
are the other side,

20:44.900 --> 20:46.740
on the left-hand side.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.460
Now, there are mixture types,
some of them.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.620
You see, they are the people
who believe in God,

20:51.820 --> 20:55.580
and they haven’t found God,
and they have worked very hard…
sort of people.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.700
So they try to give you
little, sometimes, assurances.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.660
For example, yesterday one lady came,
and she told Me,

21:01.860 --> 21:06.460
“Mataji, suddenly I found
that there were some chanas [chickpeas]
lying in my house.

21:06.660 --> 21:09.820
I thought they must have been given
by Mataji, so I ate them,
and I got cured.”

21:10.020 --> 21:15.180
I said, “Am I mad to give you chanas
and diamonds and this and that?”

21:18.820 --> 21:22.060
And there are some gurus also
who are working out
the so-called materialization.

21:22.260 --> 21:25.340
This is nothing, you see.
Sometimes, you see, you find, in Bombay…

21:25.540 --> 21:29.340
now, you find that suddenly
your something is missing.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.380
Most of the missing things
you’ll find there.

21:33.580 --> 21:36.900
And these are the things
they are passing out to people
like this — come along! —

21:37.100 --> 21:38.740
in a… jadu me [in a magic way].

21:38.940 --> 21:44.460
It is… it is a spirit,
which is transparent.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.900
It is not opaque thing,
you cannot see it.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.900
So, it comes round, picks up anything
it feels like, and it goes away.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.540
And it just disappears.

21:52.740 --> 21:57.660
And it goes, and it can also give it
to some people there.

21:58.420 --> 22:01.220
And this is all the vidya
[knowledge, lore] of spirit.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.700
Now, how are you to know
that this is spirit and not God?

22:04.900 --> 22:07.660
Only ask one question:
what is the interest of God

22:07.860 --> 22:10.620
in giving us all these
nonsensical things

22:10.820 --> 22:12.740
which we are going to leave here only?

22:12.940 --> 22:14.100
When we die,

22:14.300 --> 22:18.820
all our diamonds, all our ornaments —
everything is going to lie down here.

22:19.700 --> 22:24.260
So why should God give us
these things? Is He mad?

22:25.020 --> 22:26.780
You see, if He loves you,

22:26.980 --> 22:31.620
He’ll give you the highest,
the eternal, the greatest,

22:31.820 --> 22:34.300
the one that is promised
in all the scriptures.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.780
And you read all the scriptures.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.220
Do you find this kind of a nonsense
anywhere that Krishna came

22:39.420 --> 22:41.820
and He brought out some rings
and gave it to somebody?

22:42.020 --> 22:45.020
He did not.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.300
I mean, it can be done by Him.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.980
If He wants to do, He can do anything,
but He is not going to steal things.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.540
So this kind of supraconscious spirits
and these things do exist,

23:00.740 --> 23:01.780
believe Me, they do.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.660
But there’s nothing important for us,
because one exists in the future

23:05.860 --> 23:08.940
and another exists in the past.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.980
We have to be conscious
of the present, present moment —

23:13.180 --> 23:15.140
and this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

23:15.340 --> 23:16.860
That now, at this moment;

23:17.060 --> 23:19.260
you must understand
the dynamics of this moment,

23:19.460 --> 23:22.500
the spontaneity of this moment.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.940
So now people will say, “Then that means,
Mataji, You don’t believe in planning.”

23:28.140 --> 23:31.620
I do not. I do not believe
in human planning at all.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.260
Because when human beings plan,
you know what is the mess they create.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.860
Everywhere in the whole world,
wherever there have been planners,

23:39.060 --> 23:41.500
what has been done?

23:41.700 --> 23:44.820
I’ll give you a simple example.

23:46.420 --> 23:50.460
You plan a wedding, A to Z.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.620
Now, you’ll find, suddenly,

23:52.820 --> 23:56.260
when the bridegroom has to come
from this place to that place,

23:56.460 --> 23:59.100
something will happen
and he won’t move.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.180
He may have to go to the bathroom;

24:02.380 --> 24:05.660
maybe he wants to meet his mother,
he will be emotionally tied up;

24:05.860 --> 24:10.460
maybe his mother will come there,
and she might start crying…

24:11.460 --> 24:13.900
If you want to make it
a living marriage,

24:14.100 --> 24:17.060
then you should not plan
in such detail.

24:17.260 --> 24:22.180
You must allow the spontaneity,
the blessing of God to work out.

24:25.820 --> 24:28.060
In manner… I’ll give you
one example.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.740
You see, I do not plan out much,

24:30.940 --> 24:33.420
and I don’t bother so much
about this planning out.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.060
Today we wanted to come here
very early.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.660
These people said
we must reach there at six thirty.

24:38.860 --> 24:41.420
I was just laughing. I knew
when I had to reach I would reach,

24:41.620 --> 24:44.340
because, whatever they may try,
we cannot reach early.

24:44.540 --> 24:47.700
[UNCLEAR]?

24:50.340 --> 24:52.980
And I just could not.

24:53.180 --> 24:57.500
So why worry? Because I know
we are not going to reach early.

24:58.220 --> 25:01.780
Of course, I mean, today
supposing I have to go tomorrow,

25:01.980 --> 25:04.700
so I have to just buy the ticket
for tomorrow.

25:04.900 --> 25:08.260
Is all right, there’s no planning.
That is to be done today.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.740
But A to Z you start planning
everything,

25:10.940 --> 25:14.860
and suddenly you find this is missing
and the whole thing goes off.

25:15.060 --> 25:18.180
Let the spontaneity,
at least in human relationship —

25:18.380 --> 25:20.620
because you are such planners,
you cannot do everything else —

25:20.820 --> 25:24.740
but human relationship, at least,
try the spontaneity to work out.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.220
Now, in the Western countries,

25:26.420 --> 25:28.580
people are understanding
the value of spontaneity,

25:28.780 --> 25:32.620
but they are stupid people,
they don’t know how to harness it.

25:32.820 --> 25:35.380
I cannot even tell you
to what stupidity they go.

25:35.580 --> 25:38.700
If I tell you, you won’t believe.

25:41.060 --> 25:44.100
There are small children,
otherwise I would have told you.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.020
It is impossible to believe
how stupid they are

25:47.220 --> 25:49.300
that they believe in the spontaneity

25:49.500 --> 25:52.540
and the kind of spontaneity
they have done.

25:52.740 --> 25:55.780
All the developing countries
are now developing

25:55.980 --> 25:57.580
to be the developed countries,

25:57.780 --> 26:02.100
but we must also see in [UNCLEAR]
these developed countries are.

26:02.300 --> 26:05.300
They are stupid people.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.460
They are all right
as far as their work is concerned —

26:09.660 --> 26:12.500
they are all in time, their things
are all clean, spick and span.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.820
But if you see,
their families are broken up.

26:16.020 --> 26:20.020
Stupidity to such a limit —
a ninety-year-old woman

26:20.220 --> 26:23.860
having a love affair
with a nineteen-year-old man,

26:24.060 --> 26:27.060
and on the front page
their love letters are posted.

26:27.260 --> 26:30.620
Every newspaper you have to read,
that is the first break news coming,

26:30.820 --> 26:35.140
and all the men reading
this “great” Romeo-Juliet going on.

26:35.340 --> 26:37.180
Stupid, absolutely stupid!

26:37.380 --> 26:40.140
When you talk to them,
you find they’re such stupid people!

26:40.340 --> 26:43.420
You don’t know where to look
and what to say.

26:43.620 --> 26:48.020
You have no idea to what extent
they have gone in stupidity.

26:48.220 --> 26:50.660
Of course, they have Cadillacs,
and they have big cars,

26:50.860 --> 26:52.140
and they have big houses.

26:52.340 --> 26:57.900
But sometimes I feel it is donkeys
living inside these beautiful houses.

26:58.740 --> 27:02.420
In certain matters
they are absolutely stupid.

27:02.620 --> 27:07.540
In certain matters,
absolutely, we are crooked.

27:07.940 --> 27:11.580
They are innocent, simpletons,
but they are stupid people.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.700
We are crooked.
Now, that point I’ll touch later on.

27:15.900 --> 27:20.900
So, let us see now
that how these two types of spirits

27:21.100 --> 27:23.980
enter into us, into our psyche.

27:24.180 --> 27:28.340
They can enter through this,
they turn this thing.

27:28.700 --> 27:31.460
They turn this portion
and put inside.

27:31.660 --> 27:35.020
Now, what happens with that,
with the spirit thing?

27:35.220 --> 27:37.100
There are some —
like Ravan was there,

27:37.300 --> 27:42.100
who could only with speech
he could make people naked, absolutely.

27:42.300 --> 27:45.300
We have got one here,
exactly the same type.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.940
If he goes on giving speech,
people start taking out their clothes.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.020
Now, just think how stupid we are

27:51.220 --> 27:54.940
not to think: “By taking out clothes,
are we going to go near God?”

27:55.140 --> 27:58.660
I mean, what sort of a logic is this?

27:59.540 --> 28:02.060
When we take our bath,
we are all naked.

28:02.260 --> 28:05.300
Are we nearer God by that?

28:06.860 --> 28:09.300
All sorts of absurd things
are being taught,

28:09.500 --> 28:12.340
and people are accepting.
Thousands of people!

28:12.540 --> 28:16.780
In your great Bombay, there are
so many intellectuals, aren’t there?

28:16.980 --> 28:20.500
Doing such silly, stupid things.

28:25.380 --> 28:31.580
Then you will find lots and lots
of people just… organized.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.860
For what?

28:34.060 --> 28:37.020
“Oh, there is some gentleman
has come, you know,

28:37.220 --> 28:39.100
and he speaks very well
on this thing.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.820
And he is very good at this,
he’s a very great speaker.” —

28:42.020 --> 28:43.580
“What does he speak?” —

28:43.780 --> 28:47.660
“He speaks about how Radha
and Krishna loved each other.”

28:47.860 --> 28:50.860
Very good idea.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.460
You can have free cabaret,

28:56.660 --> 29:00.660
and you can have free discourses
on all the nonsensical things

29:00.860 --> 29:03.140
debasing God Himself.

29:03.340 --> 29:06.500
All these things are so interesting
to human beings!

29:06.700 --> 29:11.260
Are they really seeking the truth?
Are they really asking the reality?

29:11.460 --> 29:14.500
They will never read Shankaracharya.
Yesterday I told you.

29:14.700 --> 29:18.220
They will never go and find out
what Markandeya had written,

29:18.420 --> 29:21.740
they have no time to find out
what Jesus has to say about it.

29:21.940 --> 29:25.340
They don’t know
what Mohammed Sahib has said.

29:28.340 --> 29:31.780
Nanak has said so many things,
Kabira has said so many things.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.300
They are all fools.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.580
These vice have come
from somewhere to teach us

29:37.780 --> 29:41.380
about all the satanic methods
that they want to employ on us.

29:41.580 --> 29:45.100
So beware. Be careful.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.980
This is the ghor Kali Yuga.

29:48.180 --> 29:51.660
All these satanic forces are acting.

29:51.860 --> 29:57.860
Krishna has said
that “Whenever there is need

29:58.260 --> 30:01.380
to establish the Dharma

30:01.580 --> 30:04.860
and to kill the dushtas [evil people]

30:05.060 --> 30:07.420
and to save the sadhus [good people],

30:07.620 --> 30:10.020
I am born again and again.”

30:10.220 --> 30:14.060
But, I find, who is the sadhu
and who is the dushta?

30:14.260 --> 30:16.420
It is such a mixture!

30:16.620 --> 30:19.020
The Satan has entered
into all the sadhus,

30:19.220 --> 30:22.580
and sadhus are absolutely
in a conflict.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.820
This is what Kali Yuga is.

30:25.020 --> 30:28.020
It’s a very delicate matter.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.340
So, in our own being, as I said it,

30:34.540 --> 30:37.380
on the right-hand side
is the supraconscious area,

30:37.580 --> 30:38.900
and on the left-hand side

30:39.100 --> 30:43.140
is what we call
as the collective subconscious.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.140
Nearer your own being

30:45.340 --> 30:47.340
is the subconscious
on the left-hand side,

30:47.540 --> 30:49.540
which we call as the psyche part,

30:49.740 --> 30:52.020
where we store everything
that is dead,

30:52.220 --> 30:54.340
of this life and past life.

30:54.540 --> 30:58.020
And on the right-hand side,
is the preconscious mind,

30:58.220 --> 31:01.420
which we call as mana,
by which we —

31:01.620 --> 31:03.700
I don’t know, “mana” is also
very confusing thing,

31:03.900 --> 31:06.140
but English word is better,
is “preconscious mind” —

31:06.340 --> 31:09.620
with which we plan
and with which we think,

31:09.820 --> 31:14.740
and this body is maintained
through our right-hand side power.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.700
In the centre, we have got
the evolutionary power.

31:17.900 --> 31:21.620
By this power only, we have evolved,

31:21.980 --> 31:24.100
which is the conscious mind.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.220
This moment, now, at this moment.

31:27.420 --> 31:30.340
We can say that the past and future
cross like that,

31:30.540 --> 31:31.900
and in the centre is that point.

31:32.100 --> 31:36.180
Or we can say like this: that the past…
the future and the past,

31:36.380 --> 31:39.460
they pass like this in the centre,
and they pass out.

31:39.660 --> 31:43.060
So the thoughts from the past
come to the future,

31:43.260 --> 31:46.540
and the future to the past,
but they cannot stay at conscious.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.460
For example, I say,
“Now, at this moment, stop it.”

31:49.660 --> 31:51.380
You cannot.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.580
Why?

31:57.180 --> 31:58.820
Because of thoughts.

31:59.020 --> 32:01.820
The thought rises,
goes up and falls down,

32:02.020 --> 32:05.020
and disappears like that.

32:05.300 --> 32:09.940
Again, another thought rises,
rises and again falls, and disappears.

32:10.140 --> 32:15.740
Now, you can see
the rising of the thought,

32:15.940 --> 32:18.380
but you cannot see
the falling of the thought.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.220
In between these two thoughts,
there is a little gap

32:21.420 --> 32:23.420
known as vilamba [delay]
in the Sanskrit language.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.620
That is the point of conscious mind.

32:26.820 --> 32:31.620
The thoughts can come
from the supraconscious side,

32:31.820 --> 32:33.580
or can come
from the collective subconscious,

32:33.780 --> 32:35.620
can even come
from the preconscious,

32:35.820 --> 32:39.500
or can even come
from the subconscious.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.580
That’s how the thoughts waves are.

32:43.780 --> 32:47.420
But if you have to jump
into the conscious mind itself —

32:47.620 --> 32:50.300
now, at this moment —

32:50.500 --> 32:55.060
you cannot do it, because at that point
there is no thought.

32:55.260 --> 32:57.780
I am not telling you
all these things of My own,

32:57.980 --> 33:03.020
because this has been already
discovered by many psychologists —

33:03.220 --> 33:06.180
that one has to jump
into thoughtless awareness,

33:06.380 --> 33:09.700
not into the so-called trance
but into awareness,

33:09.900 --> 33:12.980
which you are completely aware,
but inside there is silence.

33:13.180 --> 33:17.740
Now, this silence has been described
by all the scriptures.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.940
And while jumping into that…

33:20.140 --> 33:24.180
even the psychologists,
so many of them said

33:24.380 --> 33:27.220
that you jump
into an unconscious mind, which —

33:27.420 --> 33:31.860
“unconscious” means
which is not known to us, achetan mana —

33:32.060 --> 33:36.220
which is collectively conscious,
which is universal.

33:36.660 --> 33:40.260
For example, we can say Jung is one
of the greatest psychologists,

33:40.460 --> 33:42.340
and I respect him very much.

33:42.540 --> 33:44.500
He has done a lot of work
on the unconscious,

33:44.700 --> 33:49.700
and he has taken many years

33:50.660 --> 33:53.700
to experiment on thousands
and thousands of people

33:53.900 --> 33:58.020
to find out how the unconscious works
through dreams and symbols.

33:58.220 --> 34:03.100
Now, he has found out many symbols
appear in the dreams.

34:03.300 --> 34:07.460
For example, a triangle like this
appears in a dream of one man,

34:07.660 --> 34:09.580
pointing downward.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.380
Invariably in all the cases,
wherever such a dream has appeared,

34:13.580 --> 34:17.260
such a man has murdered someone.

34:17.540 --> 34:20.820
Or if the triangle
is just upside down,

34:21.020 --> 34:23.980
means the top is the pointer,

34:24.180 --> 34:26.980
then invariably all these people

34:27.180 --> 34:29.900
who saw this in the dream
and reported to him,

34:30.100 --> 34:33.100
they were murdered.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.700
There are many such things
he has found out.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.580
He has found out another thing
about the Universal Unconscious —

34:40.780 --> 34:43.940
that it always gives you a balance.

34:46.020 --> 34:48.380
By different experiments.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.100
Now, the medical science people

34:50.300 --> 34:52.540
have found out many things
which they cannot answer.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.820
I have told you already
that they have found out

34:55.020 --> 34:56.780
that the acetylcholine and adrenaline,

34:56.980 --> 35:02.980
which act through the parasympathetic
and the sympathetic nervous system,

35:03.260 --> 35:05.580
they act very funnily in the body,
and they don’t know

35:05.780 --> 35:08.220
how they are controlled,
by whom, and why they act.

35:08.420 --> 35:12.180
They say the mode of action
of these two chemicals is not known.

35:12.380 --> 35:15.380
That means one thing is sure —

35:17.980 --> 35:19.980
that they cannot explain.

35:20.180 --> 35:22.980
So, we have to think: why?

35:23.180 --> 35:26.900
Why a chemical should react
separate, differently?

35:27.100 --> 35:29.980
Because there is a deity
sitting within them!

35:30.180 --> 35:31.860
There is a deity, a living deity

35:32.060 --> 35:34.860
which handles the chemicals
in the way that it likes.

35:35.060 --> 35:36.900
The other day also
I asked you a question:

35:37.100 --> 35:38.780
a medical person,
if you go and ask him,

35:38.980 --> 35:41.940
“If everything, every foreign body
is thrown out of the body,

35:42.140 --> 35:47.460
how is it a foetus is accepted,
not only that but nurtured in the body?”

35:49.780 --> 35:54.660
So we should know that there is
a Unconscious Universal Being,

35:54.860 --> 35:58.820
which is being accepted
by many people

35:59.980 --> 36:01.740
in the West.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.180
And that’s why they say:
“Let the Unconscious look after.

36:04.380 --> 36:07.100
Let us have the spontaneity,
let it work out spontaneously.”

36:07.300 --> 36:09.500
But they cannot,
they are so complicated now.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.540
They have such an analytical mind
that they’ll go on analyzing,

36:12.740 --> 36:17.340
and they cannot allow
the spontaneity to work out.

36:19.580 --> 36:24.260
They are trying all their methods
to work out the spontaneity,

36:25.580 --> 36:31.580
but somebody has to give an impetus,

36:32.700 --> 36:36.980
has to give that triggering,
as you can say.

36:37.540 --> 36:41.140
Because through rationality if you want
to jump into unconscious, you cannot.

36:41.340 --> 36:44.580
Rationality is a very limited stuff.

36:44.780 --> 36:48.940
If you want to go to something
unlimited and universal —

36:49.140 --> 36:51.140
which is collectively conscious —

36:51.340 --> 36:55.620
then you have to learn
to be unlimited yourself.

36:55.820 --> 36:58.820
Now, how will you do it?

36:59.020 --> 37:02.100
Somebody has to trigger it.

37:06.620 --> 37:10.900
You see a light, a dip [lamp, candle]
which is not yet lighted.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.460
It is a limited stuff.

37:13.660 --> 37:16.420
But when you light it,
it becomes unlimited.

37:16.620 --> 37:22.620
But for lightening this light,
you have to take another light near it.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.700
When you bring another light near it,

37:24.900 --> 37:27.580
it doesn’t do,
it’s just like a catalytic agent.

37:27.780 --> 37:30.980
It just touches this,
and it starts burning.

37:31.180 --> 37:34.100
It gets unlimited light.

37:34.300 --> 37:38.980
The light becomes unlimited
with a limited dip.

37:39.980 --> 37:44.220
In the same way,
somebody has to trigger this.

37:48.060 --> 37:52.300
I give a very, I should say,
a contemporary, or a very modern example

37:52.500 --> 37:54.860
which is very simple
for people to understand.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.980
You see, in our houses, we have seen
all these Bombay gas lights,

37:58.180 --> 38:02.660
we have seen there’s a little flicker
going on. Nobody can see that.

38:02.860 --> 38:05.420
In the same way,
in the heart there is the Spirit,

38:05.620 --> 38:09.020
the reflection of God that is there.

38:09.780 --> 38:14.820
And the flow of the gas is stopped,
is kept ready.

38:15.020 --> 38:19.780
In the same way,
in you the Kundalini is kept there,

38:20.500 --> 38:24.140
and somebody has to open that.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.540
And when that is just opened,

38:27.740 --> 38:32.540
the Kundalini rises and meets
that flicker, and the light spreads.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.980
And this is what happens
when the light spreads —

38:35.180 --> 38:38.420
that the vibrations start coming.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.940
Thus you jump
into your unconscious awareness,

38:43.140 --> 38:46.660
means you become
a different personality.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.220
As I told you, you are a computer.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.780
But you are not a working computer.

38:52.980 --> 38:55.660
Once you are connected
with the mains,

38:55.860 --> 38:58.020
you become a computer
which is giving information;

38:58.220 --> 39:02.380
suddenly you start feeling
on your fingers all these things.

39:02.580 --> 39:05.620
You start feeling what is…

39:05.820 --> 39:08.860
what are the centres on the other person,
what are not working.

39:09.060 --> 39:11.700
And these centres,
as I explained to you yesterday,

39:11.900 --> 39:17.460
have all the physical, mental,
and emotional sides, which they control,

39:17.660 --> 39:19.940
and you can make out
what’s wrong with the person.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.580
You can cure them also
by giving them these vibrations.

39:23.780 --> 39:29.420
So, through this computer,
now you get information,

39:29.860 --> 39:34.380
you give information,
and also you can correct it.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.740
You can execute also information.

39:36.940 --> 39:40.740
Now, our computers that we have,
they cannot execute.

39:40.940 --> 40:00.340
(Somebody interrupts Shri Mataji,
and She asks not to interrupt Her.)

40:03.700 --> 40:09.700
You see, lecturing about Divine
has been done by many.

40:10.220 --> 40:14.780
I am talking about actualization.

40:15.060 --> 40:17.900
You become that!

40:18.100 --> 40:22.980
Now, always people say
that “How can it be possible, Mataji?”

40:23.180 --> 40:26.700
I mean, I cannot understand
this question.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.340
Supposing I say
there is a diamond lying here.

40:31.540 --> 40:35.620
Will you ask such a question?
You’ll immediately come pick it up.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.860
I mean, you don’t have to lose
anything by this.

40:40.060 --> 40:43.100
You are not paying Me anything.
It’s all free.

40:43.300 --> 40:47.060
By doing this, you have seen here,
people have been cured.

40:48.500 --> 40:51.180
But once you get it,

40:51.380 --> 40:53.580
fifty percent of you
will feel very happy,

40:53.780 --> 40:55.660
go home and say, “All right, forget it.”

40:55.860 --> 40:59.260
One or two will criticize: “Oh, mala kahi
jhala sei, we didn’t feel anything,”

40:59.460 --> 41:00.740
as if they are very great people.

41:00.940 --> 41:03.020
If they haven’t got it,
there’s something wrong with them.

41:03.220 --> 41:06.220
They should get it.

41:06.460 --> 41:11.300
And fifty percent will think about it,
will come again and again, work it out.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.660
There are now in Bombay
some of them,

41:13.860 --> 41:17.540
very highly placed Sahaja yogis,
who are curing people.

41:17.740 --> 41:21.060
They have cured cancer.
They are very ordinary people.

41:21.260 --> 41:24.500
We have one here, a teacher
in the school,

41:24.700 --> 41:28.420
and he has cured people
who were suffering from elephantiasis,

41:28.620 --> 41:31.660
from cancer…
so many things he has cured.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.940
He is a very, very ordinary person
in life.

41:35.140 --> 41:38.900
There are so many like that
who are doing it.

41:40.660 --> 41:41.700
You can also do it.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.020
But you are great babus
[respectable people],
you are great people.

41:44.220 --> 41:47.260
You have no time for all this.

41:47.740 --> 41:51.540
When I’ll be no more, then you
will be beating your heads, I know:

41:51.740 --> 41:57.060
“I wish we had done
something about it!”

41:58.580 --> 42:02.660
Some of them
have definitely learned the art.

42:02.860 --> 42:05.100
Like, I said that “There’s a fan here.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.220
If I open the fan,
you’ll get cool breeze.”

42:08.420 --> 42:11.700
So you’ll say, “All right. Please open
the fan immediately, we want to have it.”

42:11.900 --> 42:13.580
Normally people would say that.

42:13.780 --> 42:16.020
Then I would say, “All right,
I’ll open the fan. Cool down.

42:16.220 --> 42:17.900
Now you feel nice?” — “Yes.”

42:18.100 --> 42:19.980
Then I will tell you
how this fan is made,

42:20.180 --> 42:23.420
how the electricity is produced,
all the engineering I’ll tell you.

42:23.620 --> 42:27.260
But I have also told you
a little bit of engineering.

42:28.060 --> 42:31.620
All people want to listen to lectures.

42:33.340 --> 42:36.340
Aren’t you fed up of them?

42:39.740 --> 42:42.740
Why don’t you have it?

42:43.060 --> 42:45.420
This is the blessing of God.

42:45.620 --> 42:47.580
You have to jump
into the Kingdom of God,

42:47.780 --> 42:52.060
and you just see how you are protected,
how you are looked after.

42:52.260 --> 42:53.580
There are seven chakras,

42:53.780 --> 42:59.780
and all the seven blessings
are bestowed upon you with a stroke.

43:00.100 --> 43:04.420
We have here people who have been
nothing in life after Sahaja Yoga
[Shri Mataji probably means “before”] —

43:04.620 --> 43:09.260
even this one I will give you as a…

43:09.700 --> 43:13.540
as a little chocolate
over the castor oil, as they say —

43:13.740 --> 43:18.700
that they are also very much
improved materially

43:18.900 --> 43:21.460
because it is Lakshmi
who is sitting in the Nabhi.

43:21.660 --> 43:25.220
This may appeal to many in India

43:25.700 --> 43:28.700
that Lakshmi is cured
and you improve even materially.

43:28.900 --> 43:31.540
People get promotions,
they become this, that…

43:31.740 --> 43:33.300
One example is our Dr. Nagensi.

43:33.500 --> 43:37.820
He got his Realization,
and see where he has got.

43:38.540 --> 43:40.660
Many people like that.

43:40.860 --> 43:43.860
He is a Sahaja yogi.

43:44.260 --> 43:47.740
So many people are Sahaja yogis
who have achieved things in life,

43:47.940 --> 43:49.860
but they are busy people,
some of them are.

43:50.060 --> 43:54.020
But if you could devote
a little time for sadhana,

43:54.220 --> 43:56.980
and if you come here
and see for yourself

43:57.180 --> 43:59.180
and give more, then you get more.

43:59.380 --> 44:01.700
Because why should God
give you all the time vibrations

44:01.900 --> 44:03.540
when you are not going to use them?

44:03.740 --> 44:06.140
There’s a gentleman sitting here,
his son was suffering

44:06.340 --> 44:08.340
from too much of drug.

44:08.540 --> 44:10.500
He was a young schoolboy,

44:10.700 --> 44:14.300
and he was being cheated,
and poor boy has been tried.

44:14.500 --> 44:17.460
He has spent twenty thousand rupees
just curing him.

44:17.660 --> 44:20.740
People were just giving him
drugs to sleep and drugs to sleep,

44:20.940 --> 44:22.220
only tranquillizers.

44:22.420 --> 44:25.740
And in one day he’s cured, and today
he’s sleeping nicely without anything.

44:25.940 --> 44:28.820
He had brought and showed Me
a prescription which, he says…

44:29.020 --> 44:30.620
Kiti paise bata [tell me how much was it]?
Charshe rupaye —

44:30.820 --> 44:34.580
four hundred rupees
poor man had to shell out.

44:34.780 --> 44:38.500
And for what? Not for curing!
To make that boy sleep off.

44:38.700 --> 44:43.660
I mean, that’s also a kind of a drug.
And that boy is so normal today.

44:46.260 --> 44:51.740
But there will be some satanic here
who can create problem for you.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.420
So you decide for yourself.

44:52.557 --> 45:19.117
(Shri Mataji asks the audience in Hindi
to ask Her questions.)

44:53.620 --> 44:56.620
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

45:19.477 --> 45:21.397
(A seeker asks a question.)

45:25.159 --> 45:27.399
SHRI MATAJI: How one gets it, isn’t it?

45:27.599 --> 45:28.599
All right, sit down.

45:28.799 --> 45:31.679
That’s what I’ve been saying —
that it just works out.

45:31.879 --> 45:33.999
It is a spontaneous happening.

45:34.199 --> 45:35.999
Now, we’ll see one thing,

45:36.199 --> 45:40.039
that how does a little seed
gets into a tree?

45:40.239 --> 45:41.759
It’s a living process.

45:41.959 --> 45:43.959
You’ll just say it just works out.

45:44.159 --> 45:46.719
It is already there,
that’s why it is sahaja.

45:46.919 --> 45:48.799
“Saha” means “with”, “ja” means “born”.

45:48.999 --> 45:51.399
It is absolutely spontaneous.

45:51.599 --> 45:54.479
I am an enlightened person, is a fact.

45:54.679 --> 45:58.599
And when I touch you,
you get enlightenment yourself.

45:58.799 --> 46:03.159
It’s a very, very simple thing.
All right?

46:07.279 --> 46:08.879
Another question?

46:09.079 --> 46:13.639
This was a nice one,
because we always say of “how”.

46:13.839 --> 46:17.879
SEEKER: Enlightenment through
other methods,

46:18.079 --> 46:20.119
with siddhis [supernatural powers].
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

46:20.319 --> 46:22.159
SEEKER: With siddhis,
that’s what they are called.

46:22.359 --> 46:24.439
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, is wrong.

46:24.639 --> 46:26.639
That is always been banned.

46:26.839 --> 46:31.399
You see, in the olden days also
we had people who were misled.

46:31.599 --> 46:33.199
That is the history.

46:33.399 --> 46:36.199
There are some people…
now, for example, if we had Hitler,

46:36.399 --> 46:39.399
that doesn’t mean he’s a praman
[right measure, authority].

46:40.199 --> 46:44.319
If we had somebody like…
a satanic force like Ravan,

46:44.519 --> 46:46.239
doesn’t mean that he was praman.

46:46.439 --> 46:50.439
For us, pramani is whatever achieved
the maximum.

46:50.639 --> 46:52.439
So the praman always remains the best.

46:52.639 --> 46:56.159
You see, all such people
who say that it gives siddhis

46:56.359 --> 46:58.879
are the people who are Tantrikas
[followers of the Tantra doctrine].

46:59.079 --> 47:01.599
And they were all thrown out.

47:01.799 --> 47:05.039
These are all known as kshudrata
[insignificance, meanness].

47:06.039 --> 47:08.999
But some of the people
who have written books on these things

47:09.199 --> 47:12.199
are not themselves realized,
have read this book, that book,

47:12.399 --> 47:14.839
and then they have said
that their siddhis are also there.

47:15.039 --> 47:18.879
Siddhis are nothing but you move on
to your supraconscious side.

47:19.079 --> 47:22.799
And when you move on
to a supraconscious side,
a spirit comes into you.

47:22.999 --> 47:25.959
And then what happens — you start
producing something from your hand…

47:26.159 --> 47:28.999
We had one lady in our Sahaja Yoga,
she came to us,

47:29.199 --> 47:30.759
and, you know, when I went to America,

47:30.959 --> 47:33.439
she started showing
all kinds of chamatkaras [wonders].

47:33.639 --> 47:34.999
She started telling people

47:35.199 --> 47:38.119
that “Where is your money’s lost,
you can find there,” like that.

47:38.319 --> 47:40.799
And she became very popular,
and she used to get one thousand people

47:40.999 --> 47:42.079
everyday coming to her.

47:42.279 --> 47:47.039
And ultimately she started telling them
even the number of the [UNCLEAR].

47:48.479 --> 47:51.399
So the supraconscious things
can be like that.

47:51.599 --> 47:54.599
ESP, you become
an extrasensory perceptive man,

47:54.799 --> 47:58.879
and all that is nothing
but another spirit.

47:59.479 --> 48:00.959
But human beings sit tight.

48:01.159 --> 48:04.359
You’ll be surprised, from America
two great scientists came just to see Me.

48:04.559 --> 48:05.439
For what?

48:05.639 --> 48:09.079
They said, “You must teach us how to fly
in the air. We want to leave our body.”

48:09.279 --> 48:11.319
I said, “Why? Are you not flying
already on our heads?

48:11.519 --> 48:12.719
Now what do you want to do?”

48:12.919 --> 48:16.279
They said, “Now we want to leave
our bodies and fly in the air.”

48:16.479 --> 48:17.799
So I said, “But if I tell you

48:17.999 --> 48:20.399
that this is done through the spirits,
will you do it?” —

48:20.599 --> 48:21.839
“Yes, still we want to do it.”

48:22.039 --> 48:23.039
I said, “Why?”

48:23.239 --> 48:26.199
They said, “Because Russians are doing
the same, so we want to do.”

48:26.399 --> 48:30.439
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

48:32.039 --> 48:33.959
Then I said…
and they would not, you see.

48:34.159 --> 48:36.479
Then I asked them, “Who told you?”
So they said, “Patanjali.”

48:36.679 --> 48:39.959
You know, Patanjali is a newspaper man.

48:40.159 --> 48:43.239
And Patanjali… I said,
“Look at this fellow, he came for treatment

48:43.439 --> 48:47.199
because he used to get this kind of a…
experience that used to leave his body,

48:47.399 --> 48:49.279
and he came to Me for getting cured.”

48:49.479 --> 48:53.839
And he is telling him, you go to Mataji
and She’ll make you that!

48:54.159 --> 48:57.839
And these fools, you know,
they would not listen to Me!

49:01.759 --> 49:03.119
So, the knowledge that we have…

49:03.319 --> 49:06.799
we do not have a proper method
of discrimination.

49:06.999 --> 49:09.079
We don’t know what is
absolute knowledge. This is wrong.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.279
For that, you must have vibrations.

49:13.199 --> 49:15.679
With vibrations. Now you can ask,
all those who are realized,

49:15.879 --> 49:19.839
you can ask: “Is there God or not?”
See the answer you’ll get.

49:22.639 --> 49:26.359
[UNCLEAR] means yes.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.519
All answers come,
and you can record it on your hands.

49:36.719 --> 49:39.079
Even to a small thing.

49:39.279 --> 49:41.959
You must hear Pharkay,
today he was telling Me about this,

49:42.159 --> 49:45.719
that when he… some gentleman
was somewhere,

49:45.919 --> 49:47.719
and he said
that “You just find his vibrations.”

49:47.919 --> 49:49.199
So he put his hands there,

49:49.399 --> 49:51.799
and he said, “Let me see the vibrations” —
and nothing was coming,

49:51.999 --> 49:54.479
and nothing you could feel,
and nothing of the chakras.

49:54.679 --> 49:57.479
So he then said, “He cannot be there,
because I cannot feel anything.”

49:57.679 --> 49:59.319
So, this man thought of him:
“Oh, yes, yes.

49:59.519 --> 50:01.959
He must be on the aeroplane,
he is not there.”

50:02.159 --> 50:05.159
To such an extent it goes!

50:05.679 --> 50:07.359
In London, there’s one gentleman,

50:07.559 --> 50:09.639
he said, “Mataji, can I feel
somebody’s vibrations?”

50:09.839 --> 50:11.079
I said, “You can.” —

50:11.279 --> 50:12.479
“Can I feel my father’s?”

50:12.679 --> 50:15.119
I said, “Yes. All right,
you put your hands and ask a question.”

50:15.319 --> 50:17.279
Immediately his Vishuddhi Chakra
started burning.

50:17.479 --> 50:18.559
He said, “Mother, this is burning.”

50:18.759 --> 50:20.959
I said, “You telephone to him just now.
Ask how he is.”

50:21.159 --> 50:25.519
So his mother said, “He cannot talk
to you, his throat is very bad.”

50:27.399 --> 50:30.439
And the father was very far away.

50:30.639 --> 50:35.319
“He cannot talk to you,
his throat is very bad” —
Vishuddhi Chakra is catching.

50:38.279 --> 50:41.999
All the information you get
on your hand, on your vibrations.

50:42.199 --> 50:46.119
And then, when you’ll see these books,
you’ll be surprised
they’ll be burning your hands.

50:46.319 --> 50:49.719
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Hindi.)

50:53.919 --> 50:58.479
You’ll be amazed that how you find out
who is a real guru and non-real guru.

50:58.679 --> 51:00.439
It’s so correct with this!

51:00.639 --> 51:03.599
We have got here a case of one lady.

51:03.799 --> 51:06.239
She told Me that somebody
came to see her,

51:06.439 --> 51:08.319
and, I mean, somebody
came to stay with her,

51:08.519 --> 51:10.879
her own brother or someone very near.

51:11.079 --> 51:13.719
And she started burning
all the time, this and that.

51:13.919 --> 51:16.079
So she said,
“Do you go to Satya Sai Baba?”

51:16.279 --> 51:17.759
He said, “No.”

51:17.959 --> 51:19.959
She said, “No, but how can that be?
I am getting terrible burning,

51:20.159 --> 51:22.079
as I get it from a disciple
of Satya Sai Baba.

51:22.279 --> 51:25.559
You must have been somewhere.
You must have been.”
He said, “I’ve never been there.”

51:25.759 --> 51:26.639
So she said, “Really?”

51:26.839 --> 51:28.759
And she was searching him out,
and nothing was there.

51:28.959 --> 51:33.799
So she opened his box, and in the box
there was a Satya Sai Baba’s photograph.

51:35.039 --> 51:36.919
Our [UNCLEAR] is here, you can ask him.

51:37.119 --> 51:40.999
His wife… his daughter-in-law
was a big problem in London.

51:41.199 --> 51:44.119
And they didn’t know how to locate
why she was behaving like this

51:44.319 --> 51:45.959
and she was giving them
burning like that.

51:46.159 --> 51:48.919
They opened her purse one day,
and in the purse was that photograph.

51:49.119 --> 51:51.039
The day they threw it away,
everything is all right.

51:51.239 --> 51:52.759
Otherwise it was going to be a divorce,

51:52.959 --> 51:56.599
for nothing at all — the poor lady
was vomiting, doing all kinds of things.

51:56.799 --> 51:59.799
There are so many cases like that.

52:02.239 --> 52:05.079
I mean, the proof is there.

52:05.279 --> 52:13.679
(Shri Mataji says a few phrases
in Marathi.)

52:13.879 --> 52:15.559
He called us to some place

52:15.759 --> 52:17.439
where there was a centre
of Satya Sai Baba.

52:17.639 --> 52:19.599
He said, “Mataji, You must save
those people.”

52:19.799 --> 52:23.439
When I sat there,
so many children just fainted.

52:24.199 --> 52:27.239
Then they told us that “These children
have been fainting like this.

52:27.439 --> 52:29.359
You have to do something about it.

52:29.559 --> 52:31.519
And so many children are lost.

52:31.719 --> 52:35.399
They just go away.
God knows how they are lost.”

52:36.839 --> 52:39.879
I told him, “Baba, his centre,
let him look after now. I am fed up.”

52:40.079 --> 52:41.879
What am I to do now?

52:42.079 --> 52:46.519
I must first of all create some doctors,
some realized souls.

52:46.719 --> 52:50.639
When I have some more people
to work it out, we can work it out.

52:50.839 --> 52:53.799
But one thing is there:
after getting Realization you must come,

52:53.999 --> 52:55.959
and learn it, and master everything.

52:56.159 --> 52:58.799
You become… I tell you,
each and everything of Kundalini,

52:58.999 --> 53:00.719
you can just master it.

53:00.919 --> 53:03.919
It’s very easy.

53:04.159 --> 53:05.719
It is so easy and it helps you.

53:05.919 --> 53:08.479
You know this is the power of love;
you must know how it is worked out.

53:08.679 --> 53:11.479
We know all the power of hatred only.

53:11.679 --> 53:14.359
Supposing somebody
is very unkind to you.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.599
I’ll tell you
about My husband’s secretary.

53:16.799 --> 53:19.079
She got her Realization.
And she said, “I have got neighbours,

53:19.279 --> 53:21.559
some three, four young boys,
and they are horrible hippies.

53:21.759 --> 53:25.679
They are making noise,
and they are troublesome,
and they call me an old hen.

53:25.879 --> 53:28.319
What have I to do
if they just make fun of me?”

53:28.519 --> 53:31.079
I said, “All right, what will you do?”

53:31.279 --> 53:33.559
She said, “I’m really fed up,
I’m going to give up the house.”

53:33.759 --> 53:35.519
I said, “You just don’t do like that.

53:35.719 --> 53:37.879
You just go and put a bandhan
on their house,

53:38.079 --> 53:43.479
every day thrice, like this,
and just think of Me with love.”

53:43.679 --> 53:47.599
Now she says that it is quiet
like a churchyard.

53:47.799 --> 53:48.919
“They are very quiet.

53:49.119 --> 53:51.119
And they are very kind,
they open the lift for me.

53:51.319 --> 53:54.319
When I go, they help me.”

53:59.759 --> 54:30.879
(A seeker asks a question in Hindi.
Shri Mataji answers first in Hindi
and then continues in English.)

54:31.079 --> 54:34.079
You are the instrument.

54:34.879 --> 54:37.439
You are the instrument,
you are the medicine,

54:37.639 --> 54:40.279
you are the curer,
you are the doctor,

54:40.479 --> 54:44.559
you are the computer,
you are everything.

54:45.199 --> 54:48.559
But you should become your Self.

54:50.079 --> 54:53.519
You have to become your Self.

55:00.759 --> 55:06.759
(Shri Mataji continues to speak in Hindi.)
