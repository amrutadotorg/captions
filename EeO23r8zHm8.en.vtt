00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.580
Now, the question is, for a modern man,
whether to believe

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.860
that there are spirits or not.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.780
Because it’s a very unknown area.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
And the unknown area,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.500
unless and until it is fully explored
and found out,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.340
always creates a hallucination
that it is something divine.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.260
So we have to know even about spirits:

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.500
who are they, how they act,
and how they work out.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.420
Now, many will say
that “We do not believe in spirits.”

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.260
Whether you believe it or not —
but they are there.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.420
Christ, He was not a liar.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.060
He took out spirits
and put them in the pig.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.740
And He is the man who very clearly said
that “Keep away from the spirits.”

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.700
The spirits are the people.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.780
We can be spirits tomorrow
if we want to be.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.060
When we die, we do not die fully.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.540
Only the element of earth,
which has created us…

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.420
for appearance, or which is the…

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.460
we can say, the Jala Tattva
[Water Principle], with the gross form —

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.260
that portion only dies,
the rest of it remains.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.220
And it goes into an area

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.260
which we call as Pretaloka
[the world of the dead],

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.700
where it starts becoming
smaller and smaller

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.260
till it comes to the size

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.780
of a foetus,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.420
or, you can say, a very small foetus.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.620
It waits there.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.940
But some of the people, when they die,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.660
they are dissatisfied souls.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.500
In Sanskrit we call them
as atrupta atma [unsatisfied soul].

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.140
Means, in life they have been hankering
after things too much,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.100
and they couldn’t get to their goals,
and they died.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.060
For example, a mother dies
during labour pains.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.060
Her child is born;
she sees the child and dies.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.100
She is worried
about looking after that child.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.460
A father dies suddenly in an accident.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.180
His children are left behind,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.260
and he is worried about his children
they’re looked after.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.060
There are some people
who are very ambitious in life —

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.900
very, very ambitious —

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.140
and they die before fulfilling
their ambitions.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.940
They also become spirits.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.900
There are people who have been tortured
and troubled and killed.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.820
They also die, and they don’t want
to live in the Pretaloka,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.620
but they want to trouble the people
who have troubled them.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.100
So there are types and types of people
who become spirits.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.260
We can divide them into two types.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.500
One type is the one
which is very aggressive,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.060
ambitious, egoistical,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.900
oppressive person,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.060
who dies and becomes a spirit.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.180
That area is known
as the supraconscious area.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.500
So many gurus and sadhus [ascetics]
who renounce the world

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.900
and go to the Himalayas,
and break their necks,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.780
and do all kinds of frantic things,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.420
which we call as dravidi pranayam
[a roundabout way of doing a thing] —

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.860
when they die without Realization,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.260
they also are
on the supraconscious side.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.100
And they remain on the right-hand side
of the human being.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.100
On the left-hand side…

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.260
“Human being” because human being
is a reflection

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.460
or, we can say, is the same microcosm
of the macrocosm, which is the Virata.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.260
Hence they are reflected
on the right-hand side of the Virata,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.780
and so we should say

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.940
that they are available
on our right-hand side.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.420
The other ones,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.980
we can say that they are… they belong
to the category of the people

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.460
who are suppressed, who are oppressed,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.020
who are tortured, who are troubled,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.500
who are debased, who are insulted.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.980
Such people, when they die,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.340
they want to take their revenge
by their sly methods.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.980
So they remain on the left-hand side
of the Virata

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.020
and thus are reflected in us also,
in the collective subconscious,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.580
which is on the left-hand side.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.980
Basically, these are the two styles
of people who are becoming spirits.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.220
But there can be a mixture,
there can be every type of a spirit.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.420
There could be good spirits also,
good people,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.300
who are trying to only help
their families and things like that.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.780
These spirits try to manifest.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.300
For example,
the supraconscious type spirits.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.740
There was a doctor in London, who died.
His name was Dr Lang.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.940
When he died,
he had discovered lots of things,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.820
and he wanted to continue
with his practice in London —

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.660
and he was a surgeon —

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.700
but he could not do it,
because he suddenly died.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.060
So his spirit entered into a soldier

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.380
who was living in…
who was fighting in Vietnam.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.260
And when the spirit entered into him

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.940
and told him
that “I am such and such doctor,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.220
you must go and meet my son
and my brother

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.020
and tell them that I am within you,”
the soldier could not believe it,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.940
but then he said
that “You come along with me,
and I’ll guide you to that place.”

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.420
And he took him to that hospital
where this doctor was working.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.980
The hospital was closed,
the surgery was closed,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.540
so he went and saw the son,
and he told him about this spirit
entering into his body.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.780
The son could not believe it.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.900
So he said that “I will tell you
all the secrets of our life

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.500
that we spent together
and which no one knows.”

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.700
And when he started
telling him all these things,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.300
he was amazed, he said,
“All right, I’ll open the centre.”

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.620
So they opened
a very-big-news organization

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.820
known as Late Dr Lang’s International
Curative Centre in London.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.220
Now, this organization
started working long time back,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.260
about, I think, eleven
or twelve years back.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.060
Actually, I came to know about it
because somebody who was suffering

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.900
from the treatment
of one of these people,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.220
she came to Me
and she told Me all about this,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.220
and she gave Me a pamphlet
in which they had written
all this story about Dr Lang.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.460
And what they used to say —
that “You should write to us
about your illness whatever it is.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.180
And when you write to us,
then we will organize it in such a way

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.540
that at such a time, at such a point,
at such a place —

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.180
whichever place you suggest —

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.900
something will happen to you:
you’ll start shaking in the body

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.460
and you’ll get those spirits into you
and you’ll be cured.”

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.380
It happened with this lady,
the one who came to Me first
when she told Me.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.220
Then afterwards I’ve met many of them,
even in England I’ve met some of them.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.980
So, when she came to Me…

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.900
You see, what was her trouble was…
she said that “I had some trouble.”

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.540
I think she had some minor trouble,
which was cured

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.420
but was very inconvenient thing
for her —

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.940
sort of a… it was a nuisance,
the trouble was.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.900
She was definitely cured with that.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.060
But after, say, five, six years or so,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.860
she started, you see,
shaking her body completely.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.900
Her nervousness was so much
that she couldn’t see Me.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.020
When she sat before Me,
she started shaking,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.260
her hands started shaking,
body started shaking

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.060
as if a lunatic would do that
before Me.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.900
So I told her, “See, this gentleman
has come from lunatic asylum,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.100
and he is behaving the same way
as you are behaving.”

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.100
She says, “I know.
Because I have a pain here,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.620
I have a problem here…
And I know there’s something wrong.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.580
I am not thinking properly,
and I cannot remember anything.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.860
I am a lost soul,
and I know what has happened to me.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.460
Now what can You do about it?”

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.460
Of course, I then cured her, no doubt.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.460
Because in Sahaja Yoga you can —

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.580
through vibrations of love,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.260
this Divine Love
which I told you yesterday —

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.860
you can give a bondage
to those spirits.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.460
By that bondage,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.540
you can make that bondage pass
into the Pretaloka, and they disappear.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.820
But some of these are controlled

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.060
by some of these ambitious
so-called gurus.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.580
Now, these so-called gurus
that you know of —

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.580
so-called, they call themselves gurus —
what do they do?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.060
They go… you see, if they find
some evil genius dies somewhere —

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.860
they know he is an evil genius —
then they follow his body,

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.540
they go to smashan [burning-ground],
they try to collect a part of his body,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.060
and they keep it with them.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.740
Now, the spirit, till thirteen days,
moves around the body,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.460
and it starts watching
what is the body doing.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.820
So, when the spirit, you see,
sees that his own part of his body —

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.580
which is to form again
in his own body later on —

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.300
is missing through these people
and they will be doing something,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.100
so it appears before them,
and they know how to talk.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.860
It’s easy to talk.
Even ordinary spirit person,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.100
if he comes here,
I can make them talk,

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.500
and they talk quite a lot,
all kinds of nonsense,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.980
and they also tell about these people
what these people have been doing.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.580
So, that spirit then, you know,
is captured by these people,

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.620
and they start using
these supraconscious spirits.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.820
These people being crooked

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:13.020
and very intelligent people,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.820
they start acting into their hands.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.260
Now, these spirits
are given some names.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.740
Like, they can call them Ram, Krishna…

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.180
Some people say Aim,

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.420
some says Hrim, some says Klim —
all Goddess’s names, you see.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.900
They can even give the name of Jesus
or something like that.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.900
So, what happens — that, when these…
when you go to these gurus,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.020
then, when you ask them,
they say, “We’ll give you a mantra.”

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.860
Now, you think that the mantra-giving
is a very great thing.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.860
You see, so many people
will come and tell Me —

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.820
in Marathi also, Maharashtrians
are special ones for this —

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.660
that “Mataji, mala kani guru mantra dila
[some guru gave me a mantra].”

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.660
After all, a mantra can be given…

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.180
say, kay dila mantra “Ram”
[what if mantra “Ram” is given]?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.620
Why do you need a guru
to tell you this? Use your brains!

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.220
Now, they go on saying “Ram”,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.780
and this fellow has already connected
them with the Ram

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.060
whom they have appointed
to get into this fellow.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.380
So the Ram enters into the psyche
of this person.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.980
Mostly it is through this Agnya Chakra,
which I told you.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.140
Yesterday I described
the whole Kundalini

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.820
and its places and everything.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.420
So it enters through this
into the psyche.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.980
When it enters into the psyche
on the right-hand side,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.540
you see, on the ego side
it enters into,

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.860
and it starts making the man
very egoistical.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.820
He’ll beat his wife,
he’ll beat his children,
he’ll rave and try to show off.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.060
Sometimes such a man
might get a promotion,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.540
and he’ll become so dynamic,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.380
he will… people will say,
“Oh, what has happened to him?” and…

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.580
sort of, you see, his attention,
which was…

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.740
was spent in doing other things,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.340
will be diverted
to very ambitious style of work.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.900
Now, he becomes very ambitious,
but he has no dharma in him,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.460
no love in him, no compassion in him,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.300
but he becomes
a very so-called successful man.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.940
For a short time.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.900
But after… I’ve met many like them
in Delhi also,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.460
those who have been
“initiated” like that

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:07.220
by paying quite a lot of money
to these swamis and sadhus —

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.020
and before Me
they were just rattling like this.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.740
And they said, “Mataji, this is such a lot
we are rattling before You,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.260
but even if we take a… even if we burn
a udbatti [kind of incense sticks]

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.100
in the name of God Virata,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.100
we can’t go near a temple,
we can’t go near a church.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.340
If we see anything of God,
we start rattling like this.”

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.780
And they all have resigned
from their jobs

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.500
and are settled down
as useless people.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.140
This has happened to them
within five, six years time.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.060
Young people, very young.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.180
In Singapore I’ve met one fellow.
No, not — Kuala Lumpur.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.420
You would not believe
he is only twenty-two years of age,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.020
and he is like that now.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.260
And this is the supraconscious style —
they call it transcendental thought.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.340
This is the trance they use.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.780
So, just by giving you one name —
you must also think!

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.660
After all, you cannot call like that
your God, the Almighty.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.940
By just a name?! How can you call Him!
Is He your servant?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.180
“Rama gari [fellow, man, man servant],
come along.” Can you call Him like this?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.340
“You do my job, You look after my father,
You look after my mother.”

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.620
Who are you?

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.620
Are you entitled to call like that?

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.220
And can you just tell Him
that “You have to…

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.540
You better look after everything
that I tell You,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.020
otherwise I’ll give You up.
I have no faith in You.”?

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.140
The man in his ego starts thinking
these nonsensical things.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.140
You have to surrender to God.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.620
You have to become one with Him,
you have to be authorized.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.620
Then only you can ask His help.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.900
The another supraconscious people
are another type of…

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.820
they work out in this way that, you see,
these people are the Hatha yogis —

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.940
so-called Hatha yogis,
because I call them neo-Hatha yogis.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.380
They are not real Hatha yogis.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.300
The real Hatha yogis never stay
with the human… normal…

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.340
what you call them…

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.780
citizens of a city or a village.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.220
They stay in the forest with gurus.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.220
In the Patanjali Shastra,

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.380
who is the original writer
of Hatha Yoga,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.380
he has told there are six things
a Hatha yogi has to do.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.260
He has to stay in the jungle
with a guru who is a realized soul,

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.340
and he does not have to lead
a married life,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.140
he has to be a brahmacharya,
a celibate person.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.020
And he has to do six things together.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.340
In that, meditation is there,
prana pratishtha [calming of the breath],

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.580
pratyahar [withdrawal of the senses],
yama-niyama [“dos” and “don’ts”]…

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.580
All these things mean
he has to regulate his life,

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.780
he has to lead
a very chaste and holy life.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.660
It is not meant for people
who are householders.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.180
Here now, for fashion’s sake,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.180
the Hatha Yoga has come
to all the people,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.100
and all Hatha yogis as such
get heart attacks.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.500
Yes, they do.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.020
I’ve met a doctor here —

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.420
you might be knowing him also very well,
he was a very well-known doctor —

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.900
and he was preaching Hatha Yoga,
and he had a heart trouble.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.500
And he was a heart specialist!

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.180
And when I met him, I told him,
“Doctor, be careful about your heart.
You are catching on your heart.”

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.180
He said, “How can that be?
I’ve taken my cardiogram!”

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.220
I said, “Doctor, be careful
and don’t do this Hatha Yoga.”

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.660
Because it is an extreme type
of a sadhana [spiritual practice],

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.460
which is to be done with a person
who can balance you,

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.980
where no other energy is exhausted,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.820
but only thing is,
it is just done for the sadhana,

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.900
and your guru works it out.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.540
It is done by very few people.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.540
But nowadays everybody wants to become
a cinema actor and a cinema actress.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.620
Every girl wants to be [UNCLEAR]
certain shapes

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.700
that are described
in the beauty contest.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.100
I tell you, these proportions
are absolutely satanic.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.700
I’ve read those proportions —

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.060
they are not the proportions
of goddesses. Or of gods.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.340
These proportions that are described
in these beauty contest things

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.140
are absolutely of dirty women.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.060
These proportions,
if they exist in any human being,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.860
only bad vibrations will come out.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.220
That’s why, you must have seen,
once they win that test,

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.500
then you have seen
how they become funny.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.740
These are all human conceptions,
but all the human conceptions

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.260
are such foolish things
that they do not know

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.660
that they are playing
into the satanic forces.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.260
The idea about cinema actresses,
you see — all the ladies, these days,

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.620
even in London,
even ninety-year-old women

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.220
want to be actresses.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.060
Are they mad?

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
They don’t want to be mothers.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.260
And then they will do
all kinds of dieting,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.180
torture their husbands,

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.340
and they will… I don’t know
what they are up to.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.980
You have to be good wives,
decent wives.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.020
You have to be good mothers
first of all.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.060
You are married women,
you are not actresses.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.300
And the husbands also want
to be actors or what, I don’t know,

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.740
that they are at Hatha Yoga.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.140
They want to make their body
very perfect

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.780
in those dimensions
that they are described.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.460
Who has said that these dimensions
are the best?

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.540
I mean, these days, when you see it,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.820
men, they don’t look like men,
and women don’t look like women.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.940
Women have started looking like men
or like horses,

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.980
and men have started
looking like women.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.780
It’s a wretched system.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.860
We have to be women in the full way,

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.900
and men have to be men in the full way.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.780
You have heard about Shivaji, Rana Pratap
[legendary Indian warrior kings]…

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.980
You have seen their personalities.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.700
You see, all the descriptions
of these personalities

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.260
going to drop down like anything

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.940
when you see these “actors”
and “actresses”, teeny-leeny people:

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.860
somebody slaps them once on the face,
the husband falls down dead,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.260
and the wife is running away
with another man —

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.180
all sorts of things going on
in this ghor [terrible] Kali Yuga.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.460
This is only you are playing
into the satanic forces. Nothing else.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.540
But these, I tell you,
these supraconscious people

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.100
are teaching you all these things.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.780
Then there are people
of extreme nature,

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.300
women specially,

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.900
who are pativrata
[devoted to a husband], you see.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.220
They are also nonsensical people.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.700
Because, you see,
they think they love their husband,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.700
the whole gods must fall onto them.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.420
Of course, a pativrata
is a very powerful personality.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.700
But she has to be a realized person.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.500
Otherwise, she is not realized,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.580
and she is all the time
making the husband, you see,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.940
a noose around his head all the time —
and using God for it.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.620
Is absurd!

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.020
She must allow all the freedom
to the man,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.380
to man to understand
the complete play of life.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.380
These women also, when they die,
you see, they are afraid

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.900
that their husband might marry
somebody else or whatever it is.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.140
They sit on the husband’s head only.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.460
Then the mothers, some of the mothers
who are so much involved

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.020
and selfish and self-centred,
only love their own children.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.180
They’ll say:
“He is the only son I have,”

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.780
“She is the only daughter I have.”

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.980
But what does that mean?
Why are you so misidentified?

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.420
How many times you have been born
in this world?

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.420
How many children
you have had before?

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.340
Why are you so much involved into it,
so much misidentified?

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.500
That does not mean
that you kick your children.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.500
Either they will kick their children

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.620
or they will be absolutely
downtrodden by the children.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.700
This is the extreme type
of temperament.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.820
Normal people, who love their children,
love other children also,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.660
live in a normal way,
normal, pious married life,

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.500
don’t run after other men
and don’t run after other women —

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.940
these normal people, when they die,
they go to Pretaloka,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.420
and then they are born again
as good people,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.300
and they, if they are born today,
they get Realization.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500
There are kinds and kinds
and types and types.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.980
I don’t want to waste your time
and My time

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.260
in describing all these horrid people.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.100
But on the other side,
on the left-hand side,

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.020
the debased and the sly
and the horrid and the murderers

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.180
and all that — they are all there.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.340
Oh, these are another type.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.340
Now, what these people try to do?

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:54.180
You see, sometimes
they will do some sly things.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.700
But when these people enter,
these debased ones,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.540
when they enter into your psyche,
you become lunatic or mad,
or something happens.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.060
They teach you all kinds of things.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.740
They’ll teach you how to drink,
to take to drugs, to do these things;

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.820
or if you are taking drinks,
they’ll enter into you.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.180
Because they are drunkards,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.460
so they want to drink more —
so they will drink.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.220
You’ll be amazed, you won’t believe
that in Cuba I met a lady,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.980
she was a very “dainty darling”,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.180
and she told Me that she can take
one whisky neat, one full bottle.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.420
I mean, I can’t even look at that bottle
the way she showed Me.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.260
I said, “How do you manage that?”

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.900
And her husband said, “Really,
it is true, sometimes she does it.”

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.740
So she says, “Do you know,
there’s a very big, huge Negro

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.740
who enters into my body.
And then he drinks, not I.”

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.380
She sees him coming inside this body.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.700
So these types of people
are the other side,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.740
on the left-hand side.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.460
Now, there are mixture types,
some of them.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.620
You see, they are the people
who believe in God,

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.580
and they haven’t found God,
and they have worked very hard…
sort of people.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.700
So they try to give you
little, sometimes, assurances.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.660
For example, yesterday one lady came,
and she told Me,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.460
“Mataji, suddenly I found
that there were some chanas [chickpeas]
lying in my house.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.820
I thought they must have been given
by Mataji, so I ate them,
and I got cured.”

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.180
I said, “Am I mad to give you chanas
and diamonds and this and that?”

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.060
And there are some gurus also
who are working out
the so-called materialization.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.340
This is nothing, you see.
Sometimes, you see, you find, in Bombay…

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.340
now, you find that suddenly
your something is missing.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.380
Most of the missing things
you’ll find there.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.900
And these are the things
they are passing out to people
like this — come along! —

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.740
in a… jadu me [in a magic way].

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.460
It is… it is a spirit,
which is transparent.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.900
It is not opaque thing,
you cannot see it.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.900
So, it comes round, picks up anything
it feels like, and it goes away.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.540
And it just disappears.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.660
And it goes, and it can also give it
to some people there.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.220
And this is all the vidya
[knowledge, lore] of spirit.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.700
Now, how are you to know
that this is spirit and not God?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.660
Only ask one question:
what is the interest of God

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.620
in giving us all these
nonsensical things

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.740
which we are going to leave here only?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.100
When we die,

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.820
all our diamonds, all our ornaments —
everything is going to lie down here.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.260
So why should God give us
these things? Is He mad?

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.780
You see, if He loves you,

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.620
He’ll give you the highest,
the eternal, the greatest,

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.300
the one that is promised
in all the scriptures.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.780
And you read all the scriptures.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.220
Do you find this kind of a nonsense
anywhere that Krishna came

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.820
and He brought out some rings
and gave it to somebody?

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.020
He did not.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.300
I mean, it can be done by Him.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.980
If He wants to do, He can do anything,
but He is not going to steal things.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.540
So this kind of supraconscious spirits
and these things do exist,

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.780
believe Me, they do.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.660
But there’s nothing important for us,
because one exists in the future

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.940
and another exists in the past.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.980
We have to be conscious
of the present, present moment —

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.140
and this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.860
That now, at this moment;

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.260
you must understand
the dynamics of this moment,

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.500
the spontaneity of this moment.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.940
So now people will say, “Then that means,
Mataji, You don’t believe in planning.”

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.620
I do not. I do not believe
in human planning at all.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.260
Because when human beings plan,
you know what is the mess they create.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.860
Everywhere in the whole world,
wherever there have been planners,

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.500
what has been done?

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.820
I’ll give you a simple example.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.460
You plan a wedding, A to Z.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.620
Now, you’ll find, suddenly,

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.260
when the bridegroom has to come
from this place to that place,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.100
something will happen
and he won’t move.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.180
He may have to go to the bathroom;

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.660
maybe he wants to meet his mother,
he will be emotionally tied up;

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.460
maybe his mother will come there,
and she might start crying…

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.900
If you want to make it
a living marriage,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.060
then you should not plan
in such detail.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.180
You must allow the spontaneity,
the blessing of God to work out.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.060
In manner… I’ll give you
one example.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.740
You see, I do not plan out much,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.420
and I don’t bother so much
about this planning out.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.060
Today we wanted to come here
very early.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.660
These people said
we must reach there at six thirty.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.420
I was just laughing. I knew
when I had to reach I would reach,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.340
because, whatever they may try,
we cannot reach early.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.700
[UNCLEAR]?

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.980
And I just could not.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.500
So why worry? Because I know
we are not going to reach early.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.780
Of course, I mean, today
supposing I have to go tomorrow,

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.700
so I have to just buy the ticket
for tomorrow.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.260
Is all right, there’s no planning.
That is to be done today.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.740
But A to Z you start planning
everything,

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.860
and suddenly you find this is missing
and the whole thing goes off.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.180
Let the spontaneity,
at least in human relationship —

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.620
because you are such planners,
you cannot do everything else —

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.740
but human relationship, at least,
try the spontaneity to work out.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.220
Now, in the Western countries,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.580
people are understanding
the value of spontaneity,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.620
but they are stupid people,
they don’t know how to harness it.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.380
I cannot even tell you
to what stupidity they go.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.700
If I tell you, you won’t believe.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.100
There are small children,
otherwise I would have told you.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.020
It is impossible to believe
how stupid they are

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.300
that they believe in the spontaneity

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.540
and the kind of spontaneity
they have done.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.780
All the developing countries
are now developing

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.580
to be the developed countries,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:02.100
but we must also see in [UNCLEAR]
these developed countries are.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.300
They are stupid people.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.460
They are all right
as far as their work is concerned —

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.500
they are all in time, their things
are all clean, spick and span.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.820
But if you see,
their families are broken up.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.020
Stupidity to such a limit —
a ninety-year-old woman

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.860
having a love affair
with a nineteen-year-old man,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.060
and on the front page
their love letters are posted.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.620
Every newspaper you have to read,
that is the first break news coming,

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:35.140
and all the men reading
this “great” Romeo-Juliet going on.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.180
Stupid, absolutely stupid!

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.140
When you talk to them,
you find they’re such stupid people!

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.420
You don’t know where to look
and what to say.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.020
You have no idea to what extent
they have gone in stupidity.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.660
Of course, they have Cadillacs,
and they have big cars,

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.140
and they have big houses.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.900
But sometimes I feel it is donkeys
living inside these beautiful houses.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.420
In certain matters
they are absolutely stupid.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.540
In certain matters,
absolutely, we are crooked.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.580
They are innocent, simpletons,
but they are stupid people.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.700
We are crooked.
Now, that point I’ll touch later on.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.900
So, let us see now
that how these two types of spirits

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.980
enter into us, into our psyche.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.340
They can enter through this,
they turn this thing.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.460
They turn this portion
and put inside.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.020
Now, what happens with that,
with the spirit thing?

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.100
There are some —
like Ravan was there,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:42.100
who could only with speech
he could make people naked, absolutely.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.300
We have got one here,
exactly the same type.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.940
If he goes on giving speech,
people start taking out their clothes.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.020
Now, just think how stupid we are

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.940
not to think: “By taking out clothes,
are we going to go near God?”

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.660
I mean, what sort of a logic is this?

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.060
When we take our bath,
we are all naked.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.300
Are we nearer God by that?

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.300
All sorts of absurd things
are being taught,

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.340
and people are accepting.
Thousands of people!

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.780
In your great Bombay, there are
so many intellectuals, aren’t there?

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.500
Doing such silly, stupid things.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:31.580
Then you will find lots and lots
of people just… organized.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.860
For what?

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.020
“Oh, there is some gentleman
has come, you know,

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.100
and he speaks very well
on this thing.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.820
And he is very good at this,
he’s a very great speaker.” —

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.580
“What does he speak?” —

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.660
“He speaks about how Radha
and Krishna loved each other.”

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.860
Very good idea.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.460
You can have free cabaret,

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.660
and you can have free discourses
on all the nonsensical things

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.140
debasing God Himself.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.500
All these things are so interesting
to human beings!

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:11.260
Are they really seeking the truth?
Are they really asking the reality?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.500
They will never read Shankaracharya.
Yesterday I told you.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.220
They will never go and find out
what Markandeya had written,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.740
they have no time to find out
what Jesus has to say about it.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.340
They don’t know
what Mohammed Sahib has said.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.780
Nanak has said so many things,
Kabira has said so many things.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.300
They are all fools.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.580
These vice have come
from somewhere to teach us

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.380
about all the satanic methods
that they want to employ on us.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.100
So beware. Be careful.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.980
This is the ghor Kali Yuga.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.660
All these satanic forces are acting.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:57.860
Krishna has said
that “Whenever there is need

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.380
to establish the Dharma

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.860
and to kill the dushtas [evil people]

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.420
and to save the sadhus [good people],

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.020
I am born again and again.”

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.060
But, I find, who is the sadhu
and who is the dushta?

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.420
It is such a mixture!

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.020
The Satan has entered
into all the sadhus,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.580
and sadhus are absolutely
in a conflict.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.820
This is what Kali Yuga is.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.020
It’s a very delicate matter.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.340
So, in our own being, as I said it,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.380
on the right-hand side
is the supraconscious area,

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.900
and on the left-hand side

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.140
is what we call
as the collective subconscious.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.140
Nearer your own being

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.340
is the subconscious
on the left-hand side,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.540
which we call as the psyche part,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.020
where we store everything
that is dead,

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.340
of this life and past life.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.020
And on the right-hand side,
is the preconscious mind,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.420
which we call as mana,
by which we —

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.700
I don’t know, “mana” is also
very confusing thing,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.140
but English word is better,
is “preconscious mind” —

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.620
with which we plan
and with which we think,

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.740
and this body is maintained
through our right-hand side power.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.700
In the centre, we have got
the evolutionary power.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.620
By this power only, we have evolved,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.100
which is the conscious mind.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.220
This moment, now, at this moment.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.340
We can say that the past and future
cross like that,

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.900
and in the centre is that point.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.180
Or we can say like this: that the past…
the future and the past,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.460
they pass like this in the centre,
and they pass out.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.060
So the thoughts from the past
come to the future,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.540
and the future to the past,
but they cannot stay at conscious.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.460
For example, I say,
“Now, at this moment, stop it.”

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.380
You cannot.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.580
Why?

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.820
Because of thoughts.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.820
The thought rises,
goes up and falls down,

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.020
and disappears like that.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.940
Again, another thought rises,
rises and again falls, and disappears.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:15.740
Now, you can see
the rising of the thought,

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.380
but you cannot see
the falling of the thought.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.220
In between these two thoughts,
there is a little gap

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.420
known as vilamba [delay]
in the Sanskrit language.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.620
That is the point of conscious mind.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.620
The thoughts can come
from the supraconscious side,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.580
or can come
from the collective subconscious,

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.620
can even come
from the preconscious,

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.500
or can even come
from the subconscious.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.580
That’s how the thoughts waves are.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.420
But if you have to jump
into the conscious mind itself —

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.300
now, at this moment —

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.060
you cannot do it, because at that point
there is no thought.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.780
I am not telling you
all these things of My own,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:03.020
because this has been already
discovered by many psychologists —

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.180
that one has to jump
into thoughtless awareness,

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.700
not into the so-called trance
but into awareness,

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.980
which you are completely aware,
but inside there is silence.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.740
Now, this silence has been described
by all the scriptures.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.940
And while jumping into that…

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.180
even the psychologists,
so many of them said

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.220
that you jump
into an unconscious mind, which —

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.860
“unconscious” means
which is not known to us, achetan mana —

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.220
which is collectively conscious,
which is universal.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.260
For example, we can say Jung is one
of the greatest psychologists,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.340
and I respect him very much.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.500
He has done a lot of work
on the unconscious,

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:49.700
and he has taken many years

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.700
to experiment on thousands
and thousands of people

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.020
to find out how the unconscious works
through dreams and symbols.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:03.100
Now, he has found out many symbols
appear in the dreams.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.460
For example, a triangle like this
appears in a dream of one man,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.580
pointing downward.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.380
Invariably in all the cases,
wherever such a dream has appeared,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.260
such a man has murdered someone.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.820
Or if the triangle
is just upside down,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.980
means the top is the pointer,

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.980
then invariably all these people

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.900
who saw this in the dream
and reported to him,

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.100
they were murdered.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.700
There are many such things
he has found out.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.580
He has found out another thing
about the Universal Unconscious —

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.940
that it always gives you a balance.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.380
By different experiments.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.100
Now, the medical science people

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.540
have found out many things
which they cannot answer.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.820
I have told you already
that they have found out

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.780
that the acetylcholine and adrenaline,

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:02.980
which act through the parasympathetic
and the sympathetic nervous system,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.580
they act very funnily in the body,
and they don’t know

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.220
how they are controlled,
by whom, and why they act.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.180
They say the mode of action
of these two chemicals is not known.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.380
That means one thing is sure —

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.980
that they cannot explain.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.980
So, we have to think: why?

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.900
Why a chemical should react
separate, differently?

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.980
Because there is a deity
sitting within them!

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.860
There is a deity, a living deity

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.860
which handles the chemicals
in the way that it likes.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.900
The other day also
I asked you a question:

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.780
a medical person,
if you go and ask him,

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.940
“If everything, every foreign body
is thrown out of the body,

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:47.460
how is it a foetus is accepted,
not only that but nurtured in the body?”

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.660
So we should know that there is
a Unconscious Universal Being,

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.820
which is being accepted
by many people

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.740
in the West.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.180
And that’s why they say:
“Let the Unconscious look after.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.100
Let us have the spontaneity,
let it work out spontaneously.”

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.500
But they cannot,
they are so complicated now.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.540
They have such an analytical mind
that they’ll go on analyzing,

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:17.340
and they cannot allow
the spontaneity to work out.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.260
They are trying all their methods
to work out the spontaneity,

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:31.580
but somebody has to give an impetus,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.980
has to give that triggering,
as you can say.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.140
Because through rationality if you want
to jump into unconscious, you cannot.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.580
Rationality is a very limited stuff.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.940
If you want to go to something
unlimited and universal —

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.140
which is collectively conscious —

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.620
then you have to learn
to be unlimited yourself.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.820
Now, how will you do it?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.100
Somebody has to trigger it.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.900
You see a light, a dip [lamp, candle]
which is not yet lighted.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.460
It is a limited stuff.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.420
But when you light it,
it becomes unlimited.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:22.620
But for lightening this light,
you have to take another light near it.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.700
When you bring another light near it,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.580
it doesn’t do,
it’s just like a catalytic agent.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.980
It just touches this,
and it starts burning.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.100
It gets unlimited light.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.980
The light becomes unlimited
with a limited dip.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.220
In the same way,
somebody has to trigger this.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.300
I give a very, I should say,
a contemporary, or a very modern example

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.860
which is very simple
for people to understand.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.980
You see, in our houses, we have seen
all these Bombay gas lights,

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.660
we have seen there’s a little flicker
going on. Nobody can see that.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.420
In the same way,
in the heart there is the Spirit,

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.020
the reflection of God that is there.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:14.820
And the flow of the gas is stopped,
is kept ready.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.780
In the same way,
in you the Kundalini is kept there,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.140
and somebody has to open that.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.540
And when that is just opened,

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.540
the Kundalini rises and meets
that flicker, and the light spreads.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.980
And this is what happens
when the light spreads —

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.420
that the vibrations start coming.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.940
Thus you jump
into your unconscious awareness,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.660
means you become
a different personality.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.220
As I told you, you are a computer.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.780
But you are not a working computer.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.660
Once you are connected
with the mains,

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.020
you become a computer
which is giving information;

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.380
suddenly you start feeling
on your fingers all these things.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.620
You start feeling what is…

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.860
what are the centres on the other person,
what are not working.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.700
And these centres,
as I explained to you yesterday,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:17.460
have all the physical, mental,
and emotional sides, which they control,

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.940
and you can make out
what’s wrong with the person.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.580
You can cure them also
by giving them these vibrations.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:29.420
So, through this computer,
now you get information,

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.380
you give information,
and also you can correct it.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.740
You can execute also information.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.740
Now, our computers that we have,
they cannot execute.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:40:00.340
(Somebody interrupts Shri Mataji,
and She asks not to interrupt Her.)

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:09.700
You see, lecturing about Divine
has been done by many.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.780
I am talking about actualization.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.900
You become that!

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.980
Now, always people say
that “How can it be possible, Mataji?”

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.700
I mean, I cannot understand
this question.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.340
Supposing I say
there is a diamond lying here.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.620
Will you ask such a question?
You’ll immediately come pick it up.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.860
I mean, you don’t have to lose
anything by this.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.100
You are not paying Me anything.
It’s all free.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.060
By doing this, you have seen here,
people have been cured.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.180
But once you get it,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.580
fifty percent of you
will feel very happy,

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.660
go home and say, “All right, forget it.”

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.260
One or two will criticize: “Oh, mala kahi
jhala sei, we didn’t feel anything,”

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.740
as if they are very great people.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.020
If they haven’t got it,
there’s something wrong with them.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.220
They should get it.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.300
And fifty percent will think about it,
will come again and again, work it out.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.660
There are now in Bombay
some of them,

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.540
very highly placed Sahaja yogis,
who are curing people.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.060
They have cured cancer.
They are very ordinary people.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.500
We have one here, a teacher
in the school,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.420
and he has cured people
who were suffering from elephantiasis,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.660
from cancer…
so many things he has cured.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.940
He is a very, very ordinary person
in life.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.900
There are so many like that
who are doing it.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.700
You can also do it.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.020
But you are great babus
[respectable people],
you are great people.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.260
You have no time for all this.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.540
When I’ll be no more, then you
will be beating your heads, I know:

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:57.060
“I wish we had done
something about it!”

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.660
Some of them
have definitely learned the art.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.100
Like, I said that “There’s a fan here.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.220
If I open the fan,
you’ll get cool breeze.”

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.700
So you’ll say, “All right. Please open
the fan immediately, we want to have it.”

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.580
Normally people would say that.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.020
Then I would say, “All right,
I’ll open the fan. Cool down.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.900
Now you feel nice?” — “Yes.”

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.980
Then I will tell you
how this fan is made,

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.420
how the electricity is produced,
all the engineering I’ll tell you.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.260
But I have also told you
a little bit of engineering.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.620
All people want to listen to lectures.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.340
Aren’t you fed up of them?

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.740
Why don’t you have it?

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.420
This is the blessing of God.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.580
You have to jump
into the Kingdom of God,

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.060
and you just see how you are protected,
how you are looked after.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.580
There are seven chakras,

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:59.780
and all the seven blessings
are bestowed upon you with a stroke.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.420
We have here people who have been
nothing in life after Sahaja Yoga
[Shri Mataji probably means “before”] —

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.260
even this one I will give you as a…

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.540
as a little chocolate
over the castor oil, as they say —

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.700
that they are also very much
improved materially

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.460
because it is Lakshmi
who is sitting in the Nabhi.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.220
This may appeal to many in India

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.700
that Lakshmi is cured
and you improve even materially.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.540
People get promotions,
they become this, that…

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.300
One example is our Dr. Nagensi.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.820
He got his Realization,
and see where he has got.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.660
Many people like that.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.860
He is a Sahaja yogi.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.740
So many people are Sahaja yogis
who have achieved things in life,

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.860
but they are busy people,
some of them are.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.020
But if you could devote
a little time for sadhana,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.980
and if you come here
and see for yourself

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.180
and give more, then you get more.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.700
Because why should God
give you all the time vibrations

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.540
when you are not going to use them?

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.140
There’s a gentleman sitting here,
his son was suffering

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.340
from too much of drug.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.500
He was a young schoolboy,

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.300
and he was being cheated,
and poor boy has been tried.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.460
He has spent twenty thousand rupees
just curing him.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.740
People were just giving him
drugs to sleep and drugs to sleep,

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.220
only tranquillizers.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.740
And in one day he’s cured, and today
he’s sleeping nicely without anything.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.820
He had brought and showed Me
a prescription which, he says…

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.620
Kiti paise bata [tell me how much was it]?
Charshe rupaye —

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.580
four hundred rupees
poor man had to shell out.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.500
And for what? Not for curing!
To make that boy sleep off.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.660
I mean, that’s also a kind of a drug.
And that boy is so normal today.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.740
But there will be some satanic here
who can create problem for you.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.420
So you decide for yourself.

00:44:52.557 --> 00:45:19.117
(Shri Mataji asks the audience in Hindi
to ask Her questions.)

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.620
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

00:45:19.477 --> 00:45:21.397
(A seeker asks a question.)

00:45:25.159 --> 00:45:27.399
SHRI MATAJI: How one gets it, isn’t it?

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:28.599
All right, sit down.

00:45:28.799 --> 00:45:31.679
That’s what I’ve been saying —
that it just works out.

00:45:31.879 --> 00:45:33.999
It is a spontaneous happening.

00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:35.999
Now, we’ll see one thing,

00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:40.039
that how does a little seed
gets into a tree?

00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:41.759
It’s a living process.

00:45:41.959 --> 00:45:43.959
You’ll just say it just works out.

00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:46.719
It is already there,
that’s why it is sahaja.

00:45:46.919 --> 00:45:48.799
“Saha” means “with”, “ja” means “born”.

00:45:48.999 --> 00:45:51.399
It is absolutely spontaneous.

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:54.479
I am an enlightened person, is a fact.

00:45:54.679 --> 00:45:58.599
And when I touch you,
you get enlightenment yourself.

00:45:58.799 --> 00:46:03.159
It’s a very, very simple thing.
All right?

00:46:07.279 --> 00:46:08.879
Another question?

00:46:09.079 --> 00:46:13.639
This was a nice one,
because we always say of “how”.

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:17.879
SEEKER: Enlightenment through
other methods,

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:20.119
with siddhis [supernatural powers].
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.159
SEEKER: With siddhis,
that’s what they are called.

00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:24.439
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, is wrong.

00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:26.639
That is always been banned.

00:46:26.839 --> 00:46:31.399
You see, in the olden days also
we had people who were misled.

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:33.199
That is the history.

00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:36.199
There are some people…
now, for example, if we had Hitler,

00:46:36.399 --> 00:46:39.399
that doesn’t mean he’s a praman
[right measure, authority].

00:46:40.199 --> 00:46:44.319
If we had somebody like…
a satanic force like Ravan,

00:46:44.519 --> 00:46:46.239
doesn’t mean that he was praman.

00:46:46.439 --> 00:46:50.439
For us, pramani is whatever achieved
the maximum.

00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:52.439
So the praman always remains the best.

00:46:52.639 --> 00:46:56.159
You see, all such people
who say that it gives siddhis

00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:58.879
are the people who are Tantrikas
[followers of the Tantra doctrine].

00:46:59.079 --> 00:47:01.599
And they were all thrown out.

00:47:01.799 --> 00:47:05.039
These are all known as kshudrata
[insignificance, meanness].

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:08.999
But some of the people
who have written books on these things

00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:12.199
are not themselves realized,
have read this book, that book,

00:47:12.399 --> 00:47:14.839
and then they have said
that their siddhis are also there.

00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:18.879
Siddhis are nothing but you move on
to your supraconscious side.

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:22.799
And when you move on
to a supraconscious side,
a spirit comes into you.

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:25.959
And then what happens — you start
producing something from your hand…

00:47:26.159 --> 00:47:28.999
We had one lady in our Sahaja Yoga,
she came to us,

00:47:29.199 --> 00:47:30.759
and, you know, when I went to America,

00:47:30.959 --> 00:47:33.439
she started showing
all kinds of chamatkaras [wonders].

00:47:33.639 --> 00:47:34.999
She started telling people

00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:38.119
that “Where is your money’s lost,
you can find there,” like that.

00:47:38.319 --> 00:47:40.799
And she became very popular,
and she used to get one thousand people

00:47:40.999 --> 00:47:42.079
everyday coming to her.

00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:47.039
And ultimately she started telling them
even the number of the [UNCLEAR].

00:47:48.479 --> 00:47:51.399
So the supraconscious things
can be like that.

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:54.599
ESP, you become
an extrasensory perceptive man,

00:47:54.799 --> 00:47:58.879
and all that is nothing
but another spirit.

00:47:59.479 --> 00:48:00.959
But human beings sit tight.

00:48:01.159 --> 00:48:04.359
You’ll be surprised, from America
two great scientists came just to see Me.

00:48:04.559 --> 00:48:05.439
For what?

00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:09.079
They said, “You must teach us how to fly
in the air. We want to leave our body.”

00:48:09.279 --> 00:48:11.319
I said, “Why? Are you not flying
already on our heads?

00:48:11.519 --> 00:48:12.719
Now what do you want to do?”

00:48:12.919 --> 00:48:16.279
They said, “Now we want to leave
our bodies and fly in the air.”

00:48:16.479 --> 00:48:17.799
So I said, “But if I tell you

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:20.399
that this is done through the spirits,
will you do it?” —

00:48:20.599 --> 00:48:21.839
“Yes, still we want to do it.”

00:48:22.039 --> 00:48:23.039
I said, “Why?”

00:48:23.239 --> 00:48:26.199
They said, “Because Russians are doing
the same, so we want to do.”

00:48:26.399 --> 00:48:30.439
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

00:48:32.039 --> 00:48:33.959
Then I said…
and they would not, you see.

00:48:34.159 --> 00:48:36.479
Then I asked them, “Who told you?”
So they said, “Patanjali.”

00:48:36.679 --> 00:48:39.959
You know, Patanjali is a newspaper man.

00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:43.239
And Patanjali… I said,
“Look at this fellow, he came for treatment

00:48:43.439 --> 00:48:47.199
because he used to get this kind of a…
experience that used to leave his body,

00:48:47.399 --> 00:48:49.279
and he came to Me for getting cured.”

00:48:49.479 --> 00:48:53.839
And he is telling him, you go to Mataji
and She’ll make you that!

00:48:54.159 --> 00:48:57.839
And these fools, you know,
they would not listen to Me!

00:49:01.759 --> 00:49:03.119
So, the knowledge that we have…

00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:06.799
we do not have a proper method
of discrimination.

00:49:06.999 --> 00:49:09.079
We don’t know what is
absolute knowledge. This is wrong.

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:12.279
For that, you must have vibrations.

00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:15.679
With vibrations. Now you can ask,
all those who are realized,

00:49:15.879 --> 00:49:19.839
you can ask: “Is there God or not?”
See the answer you’ll get.

00:49:22.639 --> 00:49:26.359
[UNCLEAR] means yes.

00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:36.519
All answers come,
and you can record it on your hands.

00:49:36.719 --> 00:49:39.079
Even to a small thing.

00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:41.959
You must hear Pharkay,
today he was telling Me about this,

00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:45.719
that when he… some gentleman
was somewhere,

00:49:45.919 --> 00:49:47.719
and he said
that “You just find his vibrations.”

00:49:47.919 --> 00:49:49.199
So he put his hands there,

00:49:49.399 --> 00:49:51.799
and he said, “Let me see the vibrations” —
and nothing was coming,

00:49:51.999 --> 00:49:54.479
and nothing you could feel,
and nothing of the chakras.

00:49:54.679 --> 00:49:57.479
So he then said, “He cannot be there,
because I cannot feel anything.”

00:49:57.679 --> 00:49:59.319
So, this man thought of him:
“Oh, yes, yes.

00:49:59.519 --> 00:50:01.959
He must be on the aeroplane,
he is not there.”

00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:05.159
To such an extent it goes!

00:50:05.679 --> 00:50:07.359
In London, there’s one gentleman,

00:50:07.559 --> 00:50:09.639
he said, “Mataji, can I feel
somebody’s vibrations?”

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:11.079
I said, “You can.” —

00:50:11.279 --> 00:50:12.479
“Can I feel my father’s?”

00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:15.119
I said, “Yes. All right,
you put your hands and ask a question.”

00:50:15.319 --> 00:50:17.279
Immediately his Vishuddhi Chakra
started burning.

00:50:17.479 --> 00:50:18.559
He said, “Mother, this is burning.”

00:50:18.759 --> 00:50:20.959
I said, “You telephone to him just now.
Ask how he is.”

00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:25.519
So his mother said, “He cannot talk
to you, his throat is very bad.”

00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:30.439
And the father was very far away.

00:50:30.639 --> 00:50:35.319
“He cannot talk to you,
his throat is very bad” —
Vishuddhi Chakra is catching.

00:50:38.279 --> 00:50:41.999
All the information you get
on your hand, on your vibrations.

00:50:42.199 --> 00:50:46.119
And then, when you’ll see these books,
you’ll be surprised
they’ll be burning your hands.

00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:49.719
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Hindi.)

00:50:53.919 --> 00:50:58.479
You’ll be amazed that how you find out
who is a real guru and non-real guru.

00:50:58.679 --> 00:51:00.439
It’s so correct with this!

00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:03.599
We have got here a case of one lady.

00:51:03.799 --> 00:51:06.239
She told Me that somebody
came to see her,

00:51:06.439 --> 00:51:08.319
and, I mean, somebody
came to stay with her,

00:51:08.519 --> 00:51:10.879
her own brother or someone very near.

00:51:11.079 --> 00:51:13.719
And she started burning
all the time, this and that.

00:51:13.919 --> 00:51:16.079
So she said,
“Do you go to Satya Sai Baba?”

00:51:16.279 --> 00:51:17.759
He said, “No.”

00:51:17.959 --> 00:51:19.959
She said, “No, but how can that be?
I am getting terrible burning,

00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:22.079
as I get it from a disciple
of Satya Sai Baba.

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:25.559
You must have been somewhere.
You must have been.”
He said, “I’ve never been there.”

00:51:25.759 --> 00:51:26.639
So she said, “Really?”

00:51:26.839 --> 00:51:28.759
And she was searching him out,
and nothing was there.

00:51:28.959 --> 00:51:33.799
So she opened his box, and in the box
there was a Satya Sai Baba’s photograph.

00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:36.919
Our [UNCLEAR] is here, you can ask him.

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:40.999
His wife… his daughter-in-law
was a big problem in London.

00:51:41.199 --> 00:51:44.119
And they didn’t know how to locate
why she was behaving like this

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:45.959
and she was giving them
burning like that.

00:51:46.159 --> 00:51:48.919
They opened her purse one day,
and in the purse was that photograph.

00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:51.039
The day they threw it away,
everything is all right.

00:51:51.239 --> 00:51:52.759
Otherwise it was going to be a divorce,

00:51:52.959 --> 00:51:56.599
for nothing at all — the poor lady
was vomiting, doing all kinds of things.

00:51:56.799 --> 00:51:59.799
There are so many cases like that.

00:52:02.239 --> 00:52:05.079
I mean, the proof is there.

00:52:05.279 --> 00:52:13.679
(Shri Mataji says a few phrases
in Marathi.)

00:52:13.879 --> 00:52:15.559
He called us to some place

00:52:15.759 --> 00:52:17.439
where there was a centre
of Satya Sai Baba.

00:52:17.639 --> 00:52:19.599
He said, “Mataji, You must save
those people.”

00:52:19.799 --> 00:52:23.439
When I sat there,
so many children just fainted.

00:52:24.199 --> 00:52:27.239
Then they told us that “These children
have been fainting like this.

00:52:27.439 --> 00:52:29.359
You have to do something about it.

00:52:29.559 --> 00:52:31.519
And so many children are lost.

00:52:31.719 --> 00:52:35.399
They just go away.
God knows how they are lost.”

00:52:36.839 --> 00:52:39.879
I told him, “Baba, his centre,
let him look after now. I am fed up.”

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:41.879
What am I to do now?

00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:46.519
I must first of all create some doctors,
some realized souls.

00:52:46.719 --> 00:52:50.639
When I have some more people
to work it out, we can work it out.

00:52:50.839 --> 00:52:53.799
But one thing is there:
after getting Realization you must come,

00:52:53.999 --> 00:52:55.959
and learn it, and master everything.

00:52:56.159 --> 00:52:58.799
You become… I tell you,
each and everything of Kundalini,

00:52:58.999 --> 00:53:00.719
you can just master it.

00:53:00.919 --> 00:53:03.919
It’s very easy.

00:53:04.159 --> 00:53:05.719
It is so easy and it helps you.

00:53:05.919 --> 00:53:08.479
You know this is the power of love;
you must know how it is worked out.

00:53:08.679 --> 00:53:11.479
We know all the power of hatred only.

00:53:11.679 --> 00:53:14.359
Supposing somebody
is very unkind to you.

00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:16.599
I’ll tell you
about My husband’s secretary.

00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:19.079
She got her Realization.
And she said, “I have got neighbours,

00:53:19.279 --> 00:53:21.559
some three, four young boys,
and they are horrible hippies.

00:53:21.759 --> 00:53:25.679
They are making noise,
and they are troublesome,
and they call me an old hen.

00:53:25.879 --> 00:53:28.319
What have I to do
if they just make fun of me?”

00:53:28.519 --> 00:53:31.079
I said, “All right, what will you do?”

00:53:31.279 --> 00:53:33.559
She said, “I’m really fed up,
I’m going to give up the house.”

00:53:33.759 --> 00:53:35.519
I said, “You just don’t do like that.

00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:37.879
You just go and put a bandhan
on their house,

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:43.479
every day thrice, like this,
and just think of Me with love.”

00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:47.599
Now she says that it is quiet
like a churchyard.

00:53:47.799 --> 00:53:48.919
“They are very quiet.

00:53:49.119 --> 00:53:51.119
And they are very kind,
they open the lift for me.

00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:54.319
When I go, they help me.”

00:53:59.759 --> 00:54:30.879
(A seeker asks a question in Hindi.
Shri Mataji answers first in Hindi
and then continues in English.)

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:34.079
You are the instrument.

00:54:34.879 --> 00:54:37.439
You are the instrument,
you are the medicine,

00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:40.279
you are the curer,
you are the doctor,

00:54:40.479 --> 00:54:44.559
you are the computer,
you are everything.

00:54:45.199 --> 00:54:48.559
But you should become your Self.

00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:53.519
You have to become your Self.

00:55:00.759 --> 00:55:06.759
(Shri Mataji continues to speak in Hindi.)
