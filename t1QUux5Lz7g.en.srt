1
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:14,648
Sahaja yogi: There is a very good question,
Shri Mataji:

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,968
“Why Jesus Christ and different incarnations
had to pass through the crucifixion?”

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,563
Shri Mataji: Oh, is a question of why
Christ had to pass through crucifixion.

4
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:42,273
From Bible we cannot understand Christ
so well

5
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:48,711
because only His short life of about four
years is really there.

6
00:00:57,105 --> 00:01:02,141
But actually He is Omkara. He is the Alpha
and Omega as said. He is that.

7
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:10,085
And He took His form as an embodiment
of innocence.

8
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:22,437
The original mistake we committed when
it was the question of Adam and Eve.

9
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:36,523
Now at that time we made a mistake. If we
had listen to what was to be,

10
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:41,031
we would have been realized souls long time
back.

11
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:53,617
But we wanted to know everything ourselves
so we developed a terrible ego.

12
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:05,211
As a result of that we crossed over within
ourselves. When we raised our heads

13
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:09,367
as human beings we crossed over
our attention, and there was a big cross

14
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:13,132
through which nothing could pass through.

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,375
So the man, the human being, was lost
between the cross-roads

16
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:32,273
of the conditioning and the ego.

17
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:48,117
And to pass the Kundalini through that
chakra was an impossibility.

18
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,461
So before Christ, it was believed in India
that we have to repent for our misdeeds

19
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,375
and we have to become very humble to get
over our ego.

20
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,172
But it was prophesized that Mahavishnu
will come,

21
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:19,601
and He will do the needful for you
for Agnya Chakra.

22
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:32,086
So when Christ came, people did not
understand Him in the West

23
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:36,249
or in Israel and all these places. They
never understood Him,

24
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,968
what sort of a personality He was.

25
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:49,594
So Indians still believed that Mahavishnu
still has to come

26
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:54,153
who will suck our ego and superego.

27
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:06,246
Krishna has said before Christ that
the eternal life cannot be killed,

28
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:11,075
cannot be crucified, cannot be destroyed.

29
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,276
So Christ came, who was the embodiment
of eternal life,

30
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:30,487
who was the embodiment of innocence,
who could not be killed.

31
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,292
And that’s why His resurrection had to take
place.

32
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:40,075
That’s why He was to be crucified to show
that eternal life can be resurrected.

33
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,979
So He was placed at that cross
as the symbol of resurrection.

34
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,950
The message of Christ is resurrection.

35
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,448
But now we have to understand how a great
part has been played

36
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,839
by the crucifixion of Christ.

37
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:40,174
There is a cross between of optic chiasma
within us also

38
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:47,901
and our ego and our conditioning are
on both the sides

39
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,636
are trying to press it hard, there’s
no room to go in.

40
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:08,346
Because Christ was the embodiment of Logos,
of the Omkara,

41
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:16,325
the Chaitanya what you call the vibrations.
He’s the only one who could pass through.

42
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:34,723
So He established a path for us
of resurrection.

43
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:46,325
But the way they talk about sufferings
I can’t understand.

44
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:54,153
He has already suffered for us.

45
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:00,973
He has suffered for our sins.

46
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:07,693
When He’s awakened here He sucks in on both
the sides as you see,

47
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:15,067
the karmas, the conditionings, the ego,
just like that He sucks in.

48
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:29,545
And an area is made here which is a soft
bone in your childhood,

49
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:34,512
it becomes again soft and the Kundalini
comes out of it.

50
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:54,285
Is absolutely wrong, against Christ to say
that you have to suffer to go to God.

51
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:04,660
Can we suffer more than Him?

52
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:12,739
Or do you mean to say that He has left some
sufferings for us to be done?

53
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:23,340
His is the message of joy

54
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:31,070
and of resurrection and not of suffering.

55
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:35,795
Even in India there are many people who
say, “You have done bad karmas

56
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:42,793
so you must give so much money, you must
do this, you must do that.”

57
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:58,457
His crucifixion was a part of the game
because He had to make

58
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:05,394
the way in the Agnya Chakra. To cross
the Agnya Chakra He was crucified.

59
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:10,715
But His message is not crucifixion.

60
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:17,246
People wear the cross and I feel very hurt
about it. He crucified Himself,

61
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:23,056
but that’s not the message, that’s not
[what] you should celebrate,

62
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:27,473
that He crucified. There are people who
celebrate it!

63
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,736
You have to celebrate His resurrection,

64
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:38,822
the Resurrection because human beings are
to be resurrected.

65
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:41,744
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified

66
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:46,156
and is resurrected because of one
crucifixion of Christ.

67
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:50,413
That was enough! That was sufficient.

68
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:55,913
You can’t carry the cross on your
shoulders, you don’t have to.

69
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:58,632
He has carried for you. He has done
everything for you.

70
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,976
Is said also that He died for
all the sinners – is a fact.

71
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:08,101
If He had not done that, it would have been
difficult to open your Agnyas

72
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:13,507
because two problems, I told you:
is conditionings and ego.

73
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:19,921
His crucifixion has helped the loosening

74
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:28,226
of these two horrible capacities of human
beings.

75
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:42,695
His life is to be understood in a very,
very deep sense.

76
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:50,226
But if you are like a journalist, you can
say, “Why did He crucify Himself?

77
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:54,414
If He was God, why did He get crucified?”.

78
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,825
Now the question is ‘why He got crucified?’

79
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:04,207
is how to tell these journalists who don’t
know anything about chakras.

80
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:11,942
Because it was the era or the time
of tapasya, of sacrifice

81
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:19,417
and so then all these three persons,
Buddha, Mahavira and Christ,

82
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:25,457
went into complete renunciation.

83
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:34,089
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

84
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,698
They did it for us, not for themselves.
They did not need it.

85
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:48,050
They didn’t want it, but they had to do it
to cleanse us,

86
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:54,379
to give us a proper medha, as they call it,

87
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:01,198
these Ekadesha Rudras, you see, to be
cleared out.

88
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:04,798
And they have sacrificed their lives.

89
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:08,329
They have sacrificed all the pleasures
of life.

90
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,540
For them, it was not a sacrifice. It is
just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

91
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:19,993
For such people, there’s no question
of sacrifice, but is a question

92
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:29,305
of doing something that would help to open
the chakras of the people in the future.

93
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:32,407
Without them we could not have worked out
Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:43,048
It was essential for these people
to cleanse for us these three chakras,

95
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:47,298
part of the one chakra of Christ.

96
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:54,855
All this they have worked out and that’s
why today Sahaja Yoga

97
00:12:55,056 --> 00:13:00,490
is so beautifully created,

98
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:06,964
so beautifully spreading, is working out.
We have to thank them, very much.

99
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,269
Of course, all other incarnations also have
helped,

100
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,316
you can see – Vishuddhi, then also Heart,

101
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:16,604
and all these, just right Heart,
left Heart.

102
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:21,589
All these angels, as they are called
in the Bible,

103
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,785
have helped us to cross over.

104
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:29,894
All these incarnations are responsible
in our evolutionary process

105
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:34,253
to create these ladders for us to move.

106
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:39,503
So, ultimately, you reach

107
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:44,935
the state of tapa on the sixth centre

108
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:49,766
and then in the state of Truth, satya.

109
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,883
Then the Truth comes to you through
Sahaja Yoga

110
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,156
in the brain, in the limbic area, when
the Kundalini enters,

111
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:06,562
She puts light there. She creates
enlightened personalities

112
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:12,883
and then She joins this All-pervading Power
of Divine Love.

113
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:21,767
And with this Divine Love, you are
completely changed and transformed.

114
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:30,377
So their contribution to the ascent
of human beings

115
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,268
has been great and that of Christ has been
the greatest.
