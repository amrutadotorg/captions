00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.830
So this principle of Shri Krishna

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.350
is so important that at the state,

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.550
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.470
we become complete,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.190
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:31.550
and you start feeling the vibrations,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.110
you are not yet fully complete.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.990
If you were just complete then it would have been

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.950
an end of your evolution,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.650
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.210
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.190
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.750
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.630
that means to your collective.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.310
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.950
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.870
you cannot feel the vibrations.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.669
As you saw yesterday,

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.230
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.750
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.030
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.870
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.150
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.670
their hands could not have moved that fast,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.590
they would have never felt the sweetness,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.910
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
and they would not have manifested it.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.710
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.171
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:01.830
the sweetness.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.310
In your art, in your music,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.470
in your gestures,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.510
in every way, your hands are very important.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.910
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.670
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.150
which look after our face,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.103
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.830
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.310
As a result also, you can become great actors,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.245
you can have eyes which are innocent,

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:45.670
you can have a skin which is shining,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.390
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.590
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.830
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.030
If you are a very harsh person

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.670
and a hot-tempered person

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.030
and you have harshness on your face,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.110
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.110
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.190
your face looks so miserable,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.230
everything changes and comes into the center,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.190
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.510
in the Divine way, and also you get

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.830
a very sweet countenance.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.789
Also the teeth and the tongue

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.670
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.750
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.757
You sometimes, as I told you

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:57.230
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.830
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.230
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.390
Then also your tongue improves.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.910
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.550
They cannot say something sweetly,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.230
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.510
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.669
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.470
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.510
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.750
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.750
Some people even stammer,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.230
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.950
All these things drop out

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.077
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:52.590
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.590
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.023
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:08.908
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:13.070
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.590
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.910
you just start watching it,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.070
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.829
and you do not get disturbed.

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.470
That seeing, that witnessing state

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.989
has a tremendous power.

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.910
Whatever you see without thinking,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.150
your problems get solved.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.910
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.670
- what you call 'tatasth'-

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.190
means you are standing on the shores

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.070
and so watching the waves to move -

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.830
then you know how to solve the problems.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.790
So your witness state has to be developed

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.510
and sometimes I have seen,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.030
people have to go through little difficulties

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.510
to develop that witness state.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.397
This is very important that once the Kundalini starts

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:11.670
supplying you from your Sahasrara downward,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.470
moving on your chakras

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.310
and enriching your different chakras,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.230
on the Vishuddhi chakra

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.510
when it has to stay, it really tries to

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.590
little bit take you through turmoils

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.230
and you start thinking that, "See now, my life was so blissful.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.830
I had so many blessings and now what has happened?"

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.830
But this is the time when you should become tatastha,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.924
means you should become a witness.

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:46.238
If you become a witness everything improves.

00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:54.270
For example you are say a person who is working in some place.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.630
As soon as you become a witness, you see,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.870
your attention goes inside

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.710
and you start watching things from inside out.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.470
As a result you see exactly what's wrong, where,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.150
and as you have got the power of witnessing,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.781
with that power you get over the problems that you have.

00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:17.630
Problems get solved very easily

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.917
if you know how to witness the whole situation

00:07:21.997 --> 00:07:24.870
than to get involved into it.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.710
And this is the best state which you call as Sakshiswarupatva,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.390
which you achieve when the Kundalini comes up

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.790
and the connection is established

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.790
and the Divine ray starts flowing through that

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.830
and enriches your Vishuddhi chakra.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.870
Now the name of Shri Krishna has come from the word 'krishi'

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.790
meaning 'the ploughing',

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:00.190
'ploughing' of the soil

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.230
for planting the crops.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.670
Now He is the one who has done the ploughing for us,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.805
in the sense that He has created us in such a manner

00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:20.030
that when the sprouting has to be done

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.790
you are already ready for it.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.918
But as it is we human beings spoil our Vishuddhi chakra

00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:32.790
by many wrong things, as you have seen that

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.029
we smoke or we take drugs,

00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:38.590
or we take tobaccos and all that.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.005
So our Vishuddhi chakra goes out.

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:45.750
On top of that, if you are a person who doesn't talk at all

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.070
or who talks too much or who shouts and screams

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.870
and who shows temper, raises his voices,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.470
also spoils his Vishuddhi chakra.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.470
So the first thing is that in your

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.390
using the Vishuddhi chakra, you have to remember

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.917
it is to be used for sweetness, for madhurya.

00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:12.270
If you want to say something to someone,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.390
try to say something that is sweet and nice,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.118
practice it.

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:21.751
In certain places I have seen

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.390
that people are used to a kind of a talk

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.590
and sometimes they cannot talk in the fashion that is sweet.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.630
For them it is adharma as if to talk sweetly to someone.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:37.709
They only believe that you must really talk in a manner

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.590
that will hurt others.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.550
So hurting anybody is not in the dharma of Shri Krishna.
